Attention package maintainers:

Be sure to include the *MANDATORY* "package" configuration argument when packaging 
RoboJournal for Debian or any other Linux distro:

i.e.  run "qmake CONFIG+=package robojournal.pro"

This ensures that the installation path in the Makefile is properly set to /usr/bin
instead of /usr/local/bin (as it would be during a normal build).
