<h2 id="search_overview">Search Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal provides the ability to search the current journal for
individual keywords or tags (starting in version 0.4 and later). This feature
is extremely beneficial for locating specific data in larger journals because
the search function deliberately ignores the entry range value if one has been
set. This allows you to locate and read old entries that may be outside the
current visible range on the Chronological Entry List.</p>

<p>RoboJournal's search mode is designed to be read-only; all changes to the
journal must be done from the <strong>Entries</strong> tab in order to
eliminate the possibility of write conflicts since the <strong>Entries</strong>
and <strong>Search</strong> tabs keep track of their current entries
separately. Because of this, all toolbar buttons (except <strong>RoboJournal
Preferences</strong>) are locked while Search Mode is active. Without this
protection, it would be theoretically possible for two different versions of
the same entry to exist simultaneously in memory and cause data corruption. </p>

<p>RoboJoural supports two distinct search methods. Each method has its own set
of advantages/disadvantages and is therefore suited for different
situations.</p>

<h3 id="pattern_match">Pattern Match</h3>

<p>Pattern matching searches the current journal for all instances of a
<em>literal</em> search term. Entries containing one or more matches (hits) are
displayed in the search results list. Pattern matching allows the greatest
level of precision but is generally unsuitable for broad/category-based queries
because the pattern is applied without any regard for context. All occurrences
of the pattern are highlighted for improved visibility if the highlight option
is enabled in RoboJournal Preferences. </p>

<p>Pattern matching searches for whole words by default. This means that a hit
is only counted if it is an individual word preceded by whitespace (or is the
first word in a sentence) and followed by whitespace or some form of
punctuation. Partial-word matches are defined as being a search term contained
within a larger word; for instance, using "term" as a search pattern would
match de<span style="color:#ff0000">term</span>ination in a partial word
search. Partial-word matches are only permitted if you uncheck the
<strong>Search for whole words</strong> checkbox before running the search. </p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal's pattern search function is case sensitive
("Cat" is not equivalent to "cat"). </div>

<h4 id="pattern_match_filters">Pattern Match Filters</h4>

<p>RoboJournal offers three different types of pattern matching. RoboJournal
allows you to select the type of pattern match to use before each search. The
type you should use depends widely on your needs and how much you want to limit
the search.</p>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Pattern Match: Title Only</td>
      <td class="right">This filters the pattern search to entry titles and
        nothing else. Title-based searching is ideal for situations where you
        know of the existence of several similarly-titled entries in a series
        (i.e. "Log Entry #1; Log Entry #2, etc.) and are only interested in
        finding entries from that series; searching for "Log Entry" would allow
        you to find the entire series very quickly, especially if it is spread
        out over a period of months or years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Pattern Match: Body Only</td>
      <td class="right">This option filters the pattern search to the body
        text. This mode should be used in situations where you want to locate a
        specific word or phrase but are unsure of where it may be located. This
        is very similar to the Body + Title search method but is slightly more
        conservative. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Pattern Match: Title + Body</td>
      <td class="right">This is the default pattern match "filter". In
        actuality, the word "filter" is misleading in this context because this
        option does not filter the results at all; it searches each entry's
        title and body for any and all occurrences of the search term. It is by
        far the most comprehensive search method and is ideal for situations
        where you want the largest possible number of results. The only
        drawback to this method is that it may be <em>too</em> comprehensive by
        returning a large number of false positives along with the useful
        results.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="highlighting">Highlighting </h4>

<p>RoboJournal (as of version 0.4) includes the ability to highlight all
occurrences of a search term wherever they appear. This feature is meant to
make all instances of the search term easier to find in long documents (much
like traditional highlighter pens are used to bring the reader's focus to a
specific area of text). The background colors used for the highlighter function
are <a href="preferences.html#highlighting">user-configurable</a>. </p>

<h3 id="tag_search">Tag Search</h3>

<p>RoboJournal's tagging system allows you to group entries into categories.
This allows for context-based searches (since several items with the same tag
are more likely to be of a similar topic) but lacks the precision control found
in pattern matching. Searching by tag also disables highlighting and the number
of hits per result because there is no specific search term to highlight or
term occurrences to count.</p>

<p>When you search by tag, all entries marked with the selected tag are
displayed in the results list. </p>

<h3 id="interface">Search Interface Overview</h3>

<p>The rows in the following table correspond to the numbered items in Figure
1. The following table provides information about each element in the
RoboJournal search interface: <img alt="Figure 1"

      <td class="right">This option allows you to choose which type of search
        RoboJournal should use from a drop-down list. RoboJournal will run a

        desired.

        entry in the results was made, and the <strong>Hits</strong> column
        shows how many occurrences of the current search term are in each

  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> The date format used in the Search Results'
<strong>Date</strong> column is determined by your operating system settings
instead of adhering to the format specified in RoboJournal Preferences.</div>

<p>You may sort the search results by any of the columns in ascending or
descending order; click a column header to toggle the sort algorithm between
ascending/descending. Sorting by <strong>Entry Title</strong> arranges the
entries in alphabetical order/reverse alphabetical order. Sorting by
<strong>Hits</strong> arranges entries in numerical order/reverse numerical
order depending on the number of times the search term is detected in each
entry. On the other hand, sorting by <strong>Date</strong> places the entries
in chronological/reverse chronological order. </p>

<h2 id="conducting_searches">Conducting Searches</h2>

<p>All search-related activity is conducted through the <strong>Search</strong>
tab in the RoboJournal main window (the <strong>Search</strong> tab is unlocked
during an active connection but is inaccessible while RoboJournal is in Default
State). The following procedure prepares RoboJournal for the next search
operation:</p>

<h3 id="accessing_interface">Accessing the Search Interface</h3>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Establish a new connection if you have not already done so. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Search</strong> tab (indicated by the red oval in
    Figure 2).<img alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/mw_search1.png" width="750"
    height="584" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The
    <strong>Search</strong> tab is unlocked once a connection has been
    established. </span></li>
  <li>The search interface is displayed:<img alt="Figure 3"
    src="img/screens/mw_search2.png" width="750" height="584"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: RoboJournal is now in
    Search Mode. </span></li>
  <li>Consult the "<a href="#tag_search_procedure">Search by Tag</a>" or the
    "<a href="#pattern_search_procedure">Search by Pattern</a>" section
    (depending on your search requirements) for further instructions.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tag_search_procedure">Search by Tag</h3>

<p>RoboJournal's tag-based search function allows you to search by subject.
Each entry in your journal should be marked with at least one tag that sorts
the entry into a category that describes what the entry is about. Searching
against a specific tag causes RoboJournal to display all entries that have been
placed in that particular category. Since any given entry often contains more
than one tag (and is therefore in more than one category) is is typical for the
same entry to be included in search results for multiple tags/topics.
RoboJournal's tagging system deliberately ignores the current entry range; as
such, any entry from the most recent to the oldest in the journal may be
included in the search results even if it is no longer visible on the
Chronological Entry List.</p>

<p>Use the following procedure to search for all entries marked with a specific
tag (the procedure assumes that RoboJournal is already in Search Mode):</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Search Mode</strong> list to display the available
    search methods. Select the "Search by Tag" option. <img alt="Figure 4"
    src="img/screens/tag_search1.png" width="750" height="589"

    height="584" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: The
    <strong>Selected Tag</strong> list is only unlocked while RoboJournal is in
    Tag Search mode.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Selected Tag</strong> list to select the tag you wish
    to search for from the drop-down list. Once you have made your choice,
    click the <strong>Search</strong> button to continue.<img alt="Figure 6"

    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: The Selected Tag is the

    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7: By default, the search
    results are sorted by date from newest to oldest.</span></li>
  <li>Click an item in the search results to display its contents in the Entry
    Output Pane.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="pattern_search_procedure">Search by Pattern</h3>

<p>RoboJournal's pattern search function is more versatile then tag-based
searches. Pattern matching is far more precise than tag searches because
pattern matching allows you to target a specific word or phrase and display all
entries that contain that phrase in whole or in part. However, this precision
can also be a disadvantage because the pattern match relies on <em>literal</em>
matches; RoboJournal is unlikely to display appropriate (or any) search results
if you get the pattern wrong or are not specific enough. The pattern match
function also requires you to know exactly what you are looking for ahead of
time.</p>

<p>The following procedure allows you to search for a specific pattern or
phrase:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Enter the desired search term into the <strong>Term</strong> field
    contained in the Search tab on the RoboJournal main window:<img
    alt="Figure 8" src="img/screens/pattern_search1.png" width="750"
    height="589" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 8: The word(s)
    in the <strong>Term</strong> field are the literal pattern RoboJournal will
    search for. </span></li>
  <li>Select the appropriate filter (for your situation/search requirements)
    from the <strong>Search Mode</strong> list:<img alt="Figure 9"
    src="img/screens/pattern_search2.png" width="750" height="589"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 9: Each type of pattern
    match is suited for a <a href="#pattern_match_filters">different
    purpose</a>.</span></li>
  <li>Uncheck the <strong>Search for whole words</strong> checkbox (if
    necessary). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button to continue. </li>
  <li>The search results are displayed. Click any entry in the Search Results
    area to view its contents in the Entry Output Pane:<img alt="Figure 10"

    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 10: All instances of the
    search term in the entry title or body text are clearly highlighted to make
    them easy to find.</span></li>
