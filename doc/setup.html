<h2 id="overview">Overview and System Requirements</h2>

<p>RoboJournal was originally designed to run on x86 or AMD64 CPU
architectures. Since RoboJournal's source code is publicly available under the
GPL3, RoboJournal may be ported to less common system architectures (assuming
that a full Qt environment and all necessary database applications are
available for that platform). For instance, RoboJournal is compatible with
Debian Linux systems running on MIPS, ARM, and POWERPC CPU architectures. </p>

<p>RoboJournal's system requirements are quite modest by modern standards since
the program runs with ease even on very low-end computers. The following list
addresses the <em>bare minimum</em> system requirements for the program to work
effectively at all:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>A client computer with the following hardware and software
    specifications<sup>*</sup>: 
    <ul>
      <li>Windows 2000 (or later) or Linux (kernel 2.6 or later). </li>
      <li>Pentium II or better (for 32-bit/x86). Any 64-bit CPU is likely
        adequate for custom AMD64 builds.</li>
      <li>Video display capable of achieving at least 1024x768 screen
        resolution. RoboJournal can run on 800x600 screen resolution (or below)
        but some parts of the interface may not completely fit on the screen
        even while maximized.</li>
      <li>64 MB of RAM (on Windows). </li>
      <li>58 MiB of hard disk space (on Windows). The Windows version of
        RoboJournal has a much larger installation footprint because it
        includes its own set of Qt libraries. Linux disk space requirements
        only include the RoboJournal executable itself (2-3 MiB) since Qt
        libraries on the system tend to be shared amongst all Qt apps and not
        just RoboJournal. </li>
      <li>Wired ethernet or 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network connectivity to
        interact with host/server<sup>†</sup>. Linux-based client machines
        require Internet connectivity in order to retrieve the necessary Qt
        packages.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A server (host) machine with the following specifications<sup>†</sup>: 
    <ul>
      <li>MySQL server instance (and root-level access permissions).</li>
      <li>Adequate bandwidth, memory, and processor speed to accommodate all
        database transactions. The specific requirements vary depending on your
        situation and the average system load on the machine in question. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> Compiling RoboJournal from source code may require up to
400 MiB of free hard drive space. The compiler uses this allocation as
temporary scratch space; all affected resources are freed for other use
immediately after the build process has finished. Be advised that RoboJournal
may not compile correctly if your hard drive does not have enough free space
available during build time.</div>

<p class="footnote">* Requirements do not take operating system/other software
requirements into consideration. The actual requirements are the cumulative
requirements of the entire software stack on the machine in question.<br>
<br>
† A remote server/host machine and the hardware necessary to connect to it
are only necessary if your journal database is not stored locally. In this
case, "locally" is defined as being the same machine on which RoboJournal is
installed. The server requirements should be added to the base client system
requirements if you <em>are</em> storing your database locally. </p>

<h2 id="install_mysql">Installing MySQL</h2>

<p>RoboJournal requires a working MySQL server in order to use MySQL-based
journals. This server process may run on the same computer as RoboJournal (i.e.
localhost) or be deployed on a machine located on your LAN/WAN or on the
Internet. The installation process creates a working MySQL server instance on
the computer you have selected. Once installation is complete, the affected
computer is able to receive and negotiate MySQL connections from itself and
from other machines that have the correct access permissions.</p>

<p>You should consider installing <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL Workbench</a> after you
have installed MySQL Server. MySQL Workbench is a replacement for the older
MySQL Administrator tool (which provided a similar function). Although it is
not required for MySQL Server to function, MySQL Workbench provides a visual
environment to simplify interaction with your journals and other databases. As
such, MySQL Workbench is ideal for users who are at the
beginner-to-intermediate level of MySQL proficiency. </p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal will probably work with <a
href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> (a compatible drop-in replacement for
MySQL's database engine) without any major problems but this has not been
thoroughly tested as of March 2013. Running RoboJournal on MariaDB should be
considered experimental for the time being, even on Linux distros that now ship
MariaDB as the official replacement for MySQL.</div>

<h3 id="mysql_windows">Windows Procedure</h3>

<p>The Windows installation procedure for MySQL is very straightforward. You
should begin by downloading the latest MSI installer package for Windows from
the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">MySQL website</a>. The free MySQL
Community Edition is adequate for RoboJournal's requirements but you may also
use the non-free Enterprise Version if you have a license for it. This guide
uses version 5.6.10.1 but the procedure is probably applicable (unless
otherwise noted) to newer versions as well. Once you have the installation file
(in this case, mysql-installer-community-5.6.10.1.msi), double-click its icon
to begin the installation process:</p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> The MySQL installer depends on the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET Framework</a> ≥ 4.0. You must
satisfy this dependency by installing .NET (if you have not already done so)
before you can install MySQL. You also need the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555">Microsoft
Visual C++ 2010 32-bit Runtime</a> if you intend to install MySQL
WorkBench.</div>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Windows Vista and later may request confirmation when you double-click
    the installer executable. It is safe to proceed if the publisher is listed
    as "Oracle America, Inc." If that is the case, click the
    <strong>Run</strong> button to continue. You may need to provide
    confirmation twice. Once Windows has finished configuring the installer,
    the MySQL Installer Welcome window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 1"
    src="img/screens/mysql_install1.png" width="795" height="593"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 1: MySQL installer main
    menu.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Install MySQL Products</strong> option. The License
    Agreement window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 2"
    src="img/screens/mysql_install2.png" width="795" height="593"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: MySQL Community Edition
    is available under the GPLv2.</span></li>
  <li>Once you have read the license terms, check the <strong>I accept these
    license terms </strong>box. Click the <strong>Next</strong> button to
    continue.</li>
  <li>The installer will check to see if any upgrades are possible at the
    current time. Click the <strong>Execute</strong> button. Once the check is
    finished, click the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue.</li>
  <li>The Choosing a Setup Type window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 3"
    src="img/screens/mysql_install3.png" width="795" height="593"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The option you choose
    determines which features are installed.</span> Select the option that is
    the best fit for your situation and click <strong>Next</strong> to
    continue: 
    <ul>
      <li>Most users should select the <strong>Server Only</strong> option.
      </li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Full</strong> option if you want to install
        everything. This option requires Microsoft Excel 2007 (or newer) in
        addition to the Visual C++ Runtime needed to run MySQL Workbench.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Custom</strong> option to manually pick and choose
        which components should be installed (recommended if you only want
        MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Check Requirements window informs you of any additional components
    that need to be installed. Click <strong>Next</strong> if you already have
    everything you need. You <em>must</em> install all required missing
    components before the installer will allow you to continue. When you get to
    the Installation Progress window, click the <strong>Execute</strong> button
    to begin the installation:<img alt="Figure 4"
    src="img/screens/mysql_install4.png" width="795" height="593"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: MySQL installation in
    progress.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button <em>twice</em> after the
    installation is finished to begin configuration. The MySQL Server
    Configuration (1 of 3) window is displayed:<span class="caption"><img
    alt="Figure 5" src="img/screens/mysql_install5.png" width="795"
    height="593" class="screenshot">Figure 5: Do not change any values (except
    the <strong>Config Type</strong> field) unless absolutely
  necessary.</span></li>
  <li>Change the <strong>Config Type:</strong> drop-down list item to "Server
    Machine". Click <strong>Next</strong> to continue (do not change any other
    values or enable <strong>Show Advanced Options</strong> unless you have
    good reason to make changes and you know what you are doing).</li>
  <li>The MySQL Server Configuration (2 of 3) window is displayed: <img
    alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/mysql_install7.png" width="795"
    height="593" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: The
    <strong>Next</strong> button is unlocked once the two fields that set the
    root password match.</span></li>
  <li>Enter a password for the root account in the <strong>MySQL Root
    Password:</strong> and <strong>Repeat Password:</strong> fields. The root
    password should be strong (i.e. not easily guessed). A strong password
    generally consists of a randomized ≥ 9-character series of numbers,
    upper/lowercase characters, and typographical symbols typically found on a
    keyboard. This password is <em>extremely</em> important so either memorize
    it or store it in a very safe place for future reference. RoboJournal asks
    for the root password whenever you create a new journal. 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> Do not create any other user accounts at this time
    unless you already have a journal you wish to import. In that case, go
    ahead and create the account that the imported journal is to be associated
    with.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue. The MySQL Server
    Configuration (3 of 3) window is displayed. Do <em>not</em> change any of
    the values on this window unless you know exactly what you are doing and
    have a legitimate reason to make changes. Click <strong>Next</strong> to
    continue.<img alt="Figure 7" src="img/screens/mysql_install6.png"
    width="795" height="593" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7:

  <li>MySQL will be automatically configured according to the parameters you
    provided. When the process is complete, click the <strong>Finish</strong>
    button to exit the MySQL installer.</li>
</ol>

<p>MySQL is now installed and properly configured for your Windows system. You
may now proceed with the RoboJournal installation process.</p>

<h3 id="mysql_linux">Linux Procedure</h3>

<p>Unlike Windows, most software on Linux-based systems comes from centralized
repositories managed by the various distributions. It is not unusual for
several distributions to share the same repositories. If you are using a common
distribution like Ubuntu or Fedora, MySQL can be automatically installed and
configured by your package management system. Since this process is often
handled entirely behind the scenes, there is no step-by-step graphical
installer application. </p>

<p>The following table gives the commands required to install a MySQL server on
the most common types of Linux. The various distributions are grouped into
families; Ubuntu (and all its variants) is in the Debian family while Fedora is
in the Red Hat family. In all instances, open a terminal window (bash shell or
similar) and type the appropriate command for your operating system as root or
a superuser:</p>

        have the password you intend to use ready in advance. MySQL is ready
        for use immediately after the installation process is finished.</td>

<h2 id="install_robojournal">Installing RoboJournal</h2>

<p>As a cross-platform application, RoboJournal is designed to be easy to
install on a variety of operating systems. As such, RoboJournal may be
installed on Windows 2000 and later through a traditional installer.
RoboJournal binaries are also available in package format that may be installed
on Linux-based systems through native package management tools. </p>

<h3 id="install_windows">Windows Procedure</h3>

<p>An installer package for the latest version of RoboJournal is always
available for the Windows platform. The RoboJournal installation package takes
the form of a traditional Windows installer application that may be acquired
directly from SourceForge or from one of the other software download sites on
which it is mirrored. Each version of the RoboJournal installer package uses a
distinctive naming convention (i.e. robojournal-[$version]-setup.exe) in order
to help you differentiate it from any other installer packages that are likely
to be found in your user account's Downloads folder. </p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> You should uninstall any old version of RoboJournal on
your computer before installing the latest version. </div>

<p>Once you have downloaded the installer executable, double-click its icon to
start the installation process. Windows Vista and later may require you to
provide UAC authorization before setup is allowed to continue. The Setup Wizard
is displayed after you have given the necessary permissions: <img
alt="Figure 8" src="img/screens/win_setup1.png" width="513" height="398"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 8: The Windows installer walks
you through the entire setup process. The tool looks and acts the same for all
versions of RoboJournal.</span></p>

<p>You must complete all the steps in the installer to successfully install
RoboJournal. The installer is very easy to use and provides its own
instructions during each step of the procedure.</p>

<p>All official RoboJournal releases on the Windows platform are 32-bit. The
32-bit version is fully functional on both the x86 and x86-64 CPU architectures
that nearly every version of Windows run on. However, you must build
RoboJournal from source in order to get a true 64-bit version. Instructions for
producing a 32-bit custom build are found in the "RoboJournal Compile and
Installation Guide" (stored as "compile-instructions.xhtml" in the RoboJournal
source package). Although the basic compile procedure is the same, you need
64-bit Qt libraries, 64-bit MySQL libraries, and a 64-bit compiler toolchain to
produce a 64-bit version of RoboJournal.</p>

<h3 id="install_linux">Linux Procedure</h3>

<p>Currently, an old pre-packaged version of RoboJournal (0.2.1 as of March
2013) is available in the Debian repositories (which are shared with Ubuntu and
Linux Mint). These repositories contain multiple variants of the package that
are suited for different system architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, etc.). This
package can be installed by running, <span class="console">apt-get install
robojournal</span> as root or superuser. The version in the Debian repositories
is out of date because the Debian package upgrade cycle is much slower than
RoboJournal's development process has been so far. </p>

<p>The only way to get the absolute latest version of RoboJournal on Linux is
to build it from source. This is not difficult as it sounds because all you
need are the Qt libraries that the old version of RoboJournal installs anyway
in addition to the base Linux compiler toolkit. For more information on the
compile process (including step-by-step instructions), please refer to the
"RoboJournal Compile and Installation Guide" (stored as
"compile-instructions.xhtml" in the RoboJournal source package).</p>
