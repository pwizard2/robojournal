      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <p>This page is meant to address certain questions or
      problems that various users have had so far. You should
      expect this list to grow as more questions are asked with
      each new version of RoboJournal.</p>

      <h2>Question: Why doesn't RoboJournal offer higher
      security?<br></h2>

      <p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
      <br>
      As the "<a href="index.html#limitations">Current
      Limitations</a>" section explains, RoboJournal was not
      originally designed to be a high-security program.
      RoboJournal's purpose is to allow users to create and
      maintain an electronic diary or journal on a remote server.
      By its very design, RoboJournal is already more secure than a
      traditional handwritten diary (which offers no security at
      all since anyone can pick it up and read it) since the MySQL
      server requires a username and password for each login. Even
      so, you need to ask yourself how much protection your journal
      really requires. A basic login requirement is probably enough
      to thwart casual unauthorized access attempts unless the
      attacker has root-level access to your MySQL installation (in
      which case you have far greater problems than having your
      secrets exposed).</p>

      <p>That said, there are plans in the works to harden
      RoboJournal against unauthorized access attempts even from
      the MySQL root account. Starting in a future version
      (possibly 0.6), RoboJournal will support RSA (and possibly
      AES) on-the-fly encryption for all journal content.</p>

      <h2 id="spellcheck">Question: Why does spellcheck flag some
      words incorrectly?<br></h2>

      <p><em>Will Kraft's answer</em> (updated on 6/8/14):<br>
      <br>
      The new spellcheck in RoboJournal 0.5 is still a work in
      progress. It's much better than the old one but it still has
      some bugs to work out. I hope to make more progress by the
      time RoboJournal 0.6 comes out (no idea when that will
      be).</p>

      <h2>Question: Why does the whitespace removal feature
      sometimes add lots of empty lines to a new entry?</h2>

      <p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
      <br>
      This was originally on my list of things to fix in
      RoboJournal 0.5. Unfortunately, I had to delay it again due
      to my busy schedule's tendency to cut into my free
      development time. I hope to include a fix in RoboJournal 0.6,
      along with some other low-level architectural
      changes/improvements for old bugs I haven't been able to
      address until now.</p>

      <p>The bug is most often triggered whenever you paste content
      from an external source (like a website) into a new entry and
      then save it. Once saved, the new entry shows lots of
      unnecessary whitespace in the Entry Output Pane. Whenever
      this problem occurs, it can be easily remedied by editing the
      affected entry (consult "<a href=
      "fundamentals.html#modify_entry">Modifying an Existing
      Entry</a>" if necessary) and then saving it again without
      making any changes. The whitespace removal function should
      work correctly the second time.</p>

      <h2>Question: Why isn't there a version of RoboJournal for
      Mac OS X?</h2>

      <p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
      <br>
      I have actually been planning to release RoboJournal 0.4.1 on
      Mac OS X as soon as I can. The reason why I haven't done it
      for earlier versions is because I don't have a Mac of my own;
      under the circumstances there has been no way for me to build
      or actively maintain a Mac version.</p>

      <p>Update (4/23/13): Unfortunately, my last plan for porting
      RoboJournal to OS X has recently failed; I'm now forced to
      wait for another volunteer to come along.</p>

      <h2>Question: RoboJournal has been useful to me. Is there
      anything I can do to help out?</h2>

      <p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
      <br>
      What I need the most right now are more beta testers and
      translators who are able to volunteer some of their time. As
      of 4/23/13, I'm also looking for someone who can help me port
      RoboJournal to Mac OS X.</p>

      <p>Supporting RoboJournal on Mac OS X requires a volunteer
      who can be relied on to download the current <em>stable</em>
      source code (from Github or SourceForge), compile it to run
      natively on Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" (or later), and
      package it as a .dmg archive. This must be done for each
      release cycle.</p>

      <p>Beta testers help me test new experimental versions of
      RoboJournal prior to release (usually the current
      "experimental" branch on GitHub) on a wide variety of
      operating systems and notify me of any new bugs they find.
      Beta testers also suggest new features and other ways to
      improve RoboJournal. As a beta tester, you must have enough
      development experience and skill to compile the experimental
      code yourself because I simply don't have the time to package
      and distribute custom builds on a regular basis.</p>

      <p>Translators would help me make RoboJournal available in
      other languages besides English. I'm only fluent in English
      so my ability to do this myself is extremely limited. I would
      definitely appreciate having several people who are willing
      to gradually translate all text in the program (and perhaps
      in this documentation as well) into Spanish, French, German,
      Chinese, or any other world language in which they have
      proficiency.</p>

      <p>If you are interested in any of these roles, please
      contact me at pwizard[<em>at</em>]gmail[<em>dot</em>]com.</p>
