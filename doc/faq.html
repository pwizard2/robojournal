<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This page is meant to address certain questions or problems that various
users have had so far. You should expect this list to grow as more questions
are asked with each new version of RoboJournal.</p>

<h2>Question: Why doesn't RoboJournal offer higher security?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
<br>
As the "<a href="index.html#limitations">Current Limitations</a>" section
explains, RoboJournal was not originally designed to be a high-security
program. RoboJournal's purpose is to allow users to create and maintain an
electronic diary or journal on a remote server. By its very design, RoboJournal
is already more secure than a traditional handwritten diary (which offers no
security at all since anyone can pick it up and read it). RoboJournal is not
entirely insecure since the MySQL server requires a username and password for
each login. Even so, you need to ask yourself how much protection your journal
really requires. A basic login requirement is probably enough to thwart casual
unauthorized access attempts unless the attacker has root-level access to your
MySQL installation (in which case you have far greater problems than having
your secrets exposed). </p>

<p>That said, there are plans in the works to harden RoboJournal against
unauthorized access attempts even from the MySQL root account. In future
versions, RoboJournal is going to support interaction with the GNU Privacy
Guard public-key encryption program. This new functionality will secure your
journal content by encrypting it with your public key. Once encrypted, your
private key (and the password that goes with it) is the only thing that can
decrypt the content. If someone were to read your encrypted journal without
having the private key needed to decrypt it, all the intruder would see is
ASCII-armored encrypted text. </p>

<h2>Question: Why is spellcheck disabled on my Linux version of RoboJournal?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer</em> (updated on 5/6/13):<br>
<br>I had no choice but to issue a service patch that disables spellcheck (for the time being) on all instances of 
RoboJournal that have been compiled for any Linux-based operating system. The only other [unacceptable] 
option was to leave this serious problem completely unaddressed.
</p>

<p>This decision is due to the well-known crashing bug that has plagued RoboJournal ever since the spellcheck 
feature was introduced in version 0.4. I have recently made progress on figuring out what is 
causing the bug but there is no way for me to fix it in a timely manner. I intend to replace
the spellcheck system entirely before RoboJournal 0.5 is released (since that is what the fix requires) in order to resolve
this bug once and for all. In the meantime, this patch prevents a Linux-user's copy of RoboJournal from 
crashing merely because he or she enabled spellcheck at some point. This patch is <strong>temporary</strong>; 
I intend to restore full functionality as soon as possible.<p>

<p>The patch does <em>not</em> affect the Windows version of RoboJournal because that version has 
always been immune to this crashing bug. Therefore, all custom Windows binaries will continue to
 have fully-functional spellcheck.</p>


<h2>Question: Why does the whitespace removal feature sometimes add lots of
empty lines to a new entry?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
This is on my list of things to fix in RoboJournal 0.5. </p>

<p>The bug is most often triggered whenever you paste content from an external
source (like a website) into a new entry and then save it. Once saved, the new
entry shows lots of unnecessary whitespace in the Entry Output Pane. Whenever
this problem occurs, it can be easily remedied by editing the affected entry
(consult "<a href="fundamentals.html#modify_entry">Modifying an Existing
Entry</a>" if necessary) and then saving it again without making any changes.
The whitespace removal function should work correctly the second time. </p>

<h2>Question: Why isn't there a version of RoboJournal for Mac OS X?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
I have actually been planning to release RoboJournal 0.4.1 on Mac OS X as soon
as I can. The reason why I haven't done it for earlier versions is because I
don't have a Mac of my own; under the circumstances there has been no way for
me to build or actively maintain a Mac version. </p>

<p>Update (4/23/13): Unfortunately, my last plan for porting RoboJournal to OS
X has recently failed; I'm now forced to wait for another volunteer to come
along.</p>

<h2>Question: RoboJournal has been useful to me. Is there anything I can do to
help out?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
What I need the most right now are more beta testers and translators who are
able to volunteer some of their time. As of 4/23/13, I'm also looking for
someone who can help me port RoboJournal to Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Supporting RoboJournal on Mac OS X requires a volunteer who can be relied on
to download the current <em>stable</em> source code (from Github or
SourceForge), compile it to run natively on Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" (or
later), and package it as a .dmg archive. This must be done for each release
cycle.</p>

<p>Beta testers help me test new experimental versions of RoboJournal prior to
release (usually the current "experimental" branch on GitHub) on a wide variety
of operating systems and notify me of any new bugs they find. Beta testers also
suggest new features and other ways to improve RoboJournal. As a beta tester,
you must have enough development experience and skill to compile the
experimental code yourself because I simply don't have the time to package and
distribute custom builds on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Translators would help me make RoboJournal available in other languages
besides English. I'm only fluent in English so my ability to do this myself is
extremely limited. I would definitely appreciate having several people who are
willing to gradually translate all text in the program (and perhaps in this
documentation as well) into Spanish, French, German, Chinese, or any other
world language in which they have proficiency.</p>

<p>If you are interested in any of these roles, please contact me at
