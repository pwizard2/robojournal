<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This page is meant to address certain questions or problems that various
users have had so far. You should expect this list to grow as more questions
are asked with each new version of RoboJournal.</p>

<h2>Question: Why doesn't RoboJournal offer higher security?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
<br>
As the "<a href="index.html#limitations">Current Limitations</a>" section
explains, RoboJournal was not originally designed to be a high-security
program. RoboJournal's purpose is to allow users to create and maintain an
electronic diary or journal on a remote server. By its very design, RoboJournal
is already more secure than a traditional handwritten diary (which offers no
security at all since anyone can pick it up and read it). RoboJournal is not
entirely insecure since the MySQL server requires a username and password for
each login. Even so, you need to ask yourself how much protection your journal
really requires. A basic login requirement is probably enough to thwart casual
unauthorized access attempts unless the attacker has root-level access to your
MySQL installation (in which case you have far greater problems than having
your secrets exposed). </p>

<p>That said, there are plans in the works to harden RoboJournal against
unauthorized access attempts even from the MySQL root account. In future
versions, RoboJournal is going to support interaction with the GNU Privacy
Guard public-key encryption program. This new functionality will secure your
journal content by encrypting it with your public key. Once encrypted, your
private key (and the password that goes with it) is the only thing that can
decrypt the content. If someone were to read your encrypted journal without
having the private key needed to decrypt it, all the intruder would see is
ASCII-armored encrypted text. </p>

<h2>Question: Why doesn't the spell check in RoboJournal 0.4 and 0.4.1 work on
Ubuntu "Quantal" and Linux Mint?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
Sadly, this has nothing to do with RoboJournal so there is no real way for me
to fix it (and I assure you that it's not from a lack of trying). Through
extensive debugging, it appears the problem lies somewhere in the Qt 4.8.3
libraries or in the core C++ libraries in the Quantal repositories. As such,
this bug affects all distros that draw from the Quantal repositories, including
Ubuntu, its variants (Kubuntu, Xubuntu, et al.), and Linux Mint. The problem
also affects Debian "Wheezy". </p>

<p>In all instances, the bug manifests as a segmentation fault/buffer overflow
error that causes RoboJournal to suddenly crash whenever the user tries to
activate the Editor (as demonstrated in "<a
href="fundamentals.html#new_entry">Writing a New Entry</a>" or "<a
href="fundamentals.html#modify_entry">Modifying an Existing Entry</a>") while
spell check is enabled in RoboJournal Preferences. Even more strangely, it is
impossible to debug this error properly because the bug only affects release
builds compiled against these libraries (debug builds work properly and do
<em>not</em> crash). Since debuggers like <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/">GDB</a> do not work correctly with
release builds, there is no way for me to investigate this problem further.
Running GDB against a debug build is futile because the crash never occurs (so
there is nothing to debug).</p>

<p>The exact same code runs on Windows without producing this error so the
problem lies somewhere in those specific Linux Qt libraries. Furthermore, I
have extensively tested RoboJournal with a custom-compiled Qt 4.8.4 environment
on Linux and everything works fine under those conditions (apparently whatever
caused this bug was fixed between version 4.8.3 and 4.8.4). I hope this bug
will simply resolve itself when the Debian package maintainers replace the
affected Qt 4.8.3 libraries with a new version. In the meantime, possible
solutions include:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Simply run RoboJournal with spell check disabled (easiest solution).</li>
  <li>Compile a "debug" build of RoboJournal for use on Linux. The debug build
    is much larger in file size because of the debug headers it contains but
    these can probably be stripped out with no ill effects (though I haven't
    tested this). Either way, everything should work fine since debug builds
    seem to be immune to this crashing bug.</li>
  <li>Build your own custom Qt from source and compile RoboJournal against that
    (hardest solution).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Question: Why does the whitespace removal feature sometimes add lots of
empty lines to a new entry?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
This is on my list of things to fix in RoboJournal 0.5. </p>

<p>The bug is most often triggered whenever you paste content from an external
source (like a website) into a new entry and then save it. Once saved, the new
entry shows lots of unnecessary whitespace in the Entry Output Pane. Whenever
this problem occurs, it can be easily remedied by editing the affected entry
(consult "<a href="fundamentals.html#modify_entry">Modifying an Existing
Entry</a>" if necessary) and then saving it again without making any changes.
The whitespace removal function should work correctly the second time. </p>

<h2>Question: Why isn't there a version of RoboJournal for Mac OS X?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
I have actually been planning to release RoboJournal 0.4.1 on Mac OS X as soon
as I can. The reason why I haven't done it for earlier versions is because I
don't have a Mac of my own; under the circumstances there was no way for me to
build or actively maintain a Mac version. Fortunately, I have found someone who
might be able to help; if so, you can expect a Mac version very soon. </p>

<h2>Question: RoboJournal has been useful to me. Is there anything I can do to
help out?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
What I need the most right now are more beta testers and translators who are
able to volunteer some of their time.</p>

<p>Beta testers help me test new experimental versions of RoboJournal prior to
release (usually the current "experimental" branch on GitHub) on a wide variety
of operating systems and notify me of any new bugs they find. Beta testers also
suggest new features and other ways to improve RoboJournal. As a beta tester,
you must have enough development experience and skill to compile the
experimental code yourself because I simply don't have the time to package and
distribute custom builds on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Translators would help me make RoboJournal available in other languages
besides English. I'm only fluent in English so my ability to do this myself is
extremely limited. I would definitely appreciate having several people who are
willing to gradually translate all text in the program (and perhaps in this
documentation as well) into Spanish, French, German, Chinese, or any other
world language in which they have proficiency.</p>
