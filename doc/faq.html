<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This page is meant to address certain questions or problems that various
users have had so far. You should expect this list to grow as more questions
are asked with each new version of RoboJournal.</p>

<h2>Question: Why doesn't RoboJournal offer higher security?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em><br>
</p>

<p><br>
As the "<a href="../../robojournal/doc/index.html#limitations">Current
Limitations</a>" section explains, RoboJournal was not originally designed to
be a high-security program. RoboJournal's purpose is to allow users to create
and maintain an electronic diary or journal on a remote server. By its very
design, RoboJournal is already more secure than a traditional handwritten diary
(which offers no security at all since anyone can pick it up and read it) since
the MySQL server requires a username and password for each login. Even so, you
need to ask yourself how much protection your journal really requires. A basic
login requirement is probably enough to thwart casual unauthorized access
attempts unless the attacker has root-level access to your MySQL installation
(in which case you have far greater problems than having your secrets exposed).
</p>

<p>That said, there are plans in the works to harden RoboJournal against
unauthorized access attempts even from the MySQL root account. Starting in a
future version (most likely 0.6), RoboJournal will support RSA and/or AES
on-the-fly encryption for all journal content. <br>
</p>

<h2 id="spellcheck">Question: Why is spell check disabled on the Linux version
of RoboJournal 0.4.2?<br>
</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer</em> (updated on 8/30/13):<br>
<br>
I had no choice but to issue a service patch that disables spell check (for the
time being) on all instances of RoboJournal that have been compiled for any
Linux-based operating system. The only other [unacceptable] option was to leave
this serious problem completely unaddressed. </p>

<p>This decision is due to the well-known crashing bug that has plagued
RoboJournal ever since the spell check feature was introduced in version 0.4. I
have recently made progress on figuring out what is causing the bug but there
is no way for me to fix it in a timely manner. I intend to replace the spell
check system entirely before RoboJournal 0.5 is released (since that is what
the fix requires) in order to resolve this bug once and for all. In the
meantime, this patch prevents a Linux-user's copy of RoboJournal from crashing
merely because he or she enabled spell check at some point. This patch is
<strong>temporary</strong>; I intend to restore full spell check functionality
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The patch does <em>not</em> affect the Windows version of RoboJournal
because that version has always been immune to this crashing bug. Therefore,
all custom Windows binaries will continue to have fully-functional spell
check.</p>

<h2>Question: Why does the whitespace removal feature sometimes add lots of
empty lines to a new entry?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
This is on my list of things to fix in RoboJournal 0.5. </p>

<p>The bug is most often triggered whenever you paste content from an external
source (like a website) into a new entry and then save it. Once saved, the new
entry shows lots of unnecessary whitespace in the Entry Output Pane. Whenever
this problem occurs, it can be easily remedied by editing the affected entry
(consult "<a href="fundamentals.html#modify_entry">Modifying an Existing
Entry</a>" if necessary) and then saving it again without making any changes.
The whitespace removal function should work correctly the second time. </p>

<h2>Question: Why isn't there a version of RoboJournal for Mac OS X?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
I have actually been planning to release RoboJournal on Mac OS X as soon as I
can. The reason why I haven't done it for earlier versions is because I don't
have a Mac of my own; under the circumstances there has been no way for me to
build or actively maintain a Mac version. </p>

<p>Update (4/23/13): Unfortunately, my last plan for porting RoboJournal to OS
X has recently failed. I'm now forced to wait for another volunteer to come
along.</p>

<h2>Question: RoboJournal has been useful to me. Is there anything I can do to
help out?</h2>

<p><em>Will Kraft's answer:</em> <br>
<br>
What I need the most right now are more beta testers and translators who are
able to volunteer some of their time. As of 4/23/13, I'm also looking for
someone who can help me port RoboJournal to Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Supporting RoboJournal on Mac OS X requires a volunteer who can be relied on
to download the current <em>stable</em> source code (from Github or
SourceForge), compile it to run natively on Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion" (or
later), and package it as a .dmg archive. This must be done for each release
cycle.</p>

<p>Beta testers help me test new experimental versions of RoboJournal prior to
release (usually the current "experimental" branch on GitHub) on a wide variety
of operating systems and notify me of any new bugs they find. Beta testers also
suggest new features and other ways to improve RoboJournal. As a beta tester,
you must have enough development experience and skill to compile the
experimental code yourself because I simply don't have the time to package and
distribute custom builds on a regular basis. </p>

<p>Translators would help me make RoboJournal available in other languages
besides English. I'm only fluent in English so my ability to do this myself is
extremely limited. I would definitely appreciate having several people who are
willing to gradually translate all text in the program (and perhaps in this
documentation as well) into Spanish, French, German, Chinese, or any other
world language in which they have proficiency.</p>
