      <h2 id="Tagging">Tagging Overview</h2>

      <p>As a journal gradually increases in size over the term of
      months and years, you will probably write about similar
      topics multiple times. If you are not using a <a href=
      "preferences.html#entry_settings">range limit</a> on such a
      journal, related entries can be harder to find and/or track
      once the sheer volume of entries is taken into account. While
      RoboJournal allows you to <a href=
      "search.html#pattern_search_procedure">search for an entry
      using a keyword system</a>, it is far easier to use the
      built-in tagging system to keep related entries together.</p>

      <p>RoboJournal's tagging system is designed to work with the
      currently-selected entry in the Timeline or the entry that is
      currently open in the Editor. As such, using the tagging
      system requires an active database connection. All
      tag-related functionality is locked while RoboJournal is in
      Default State due to there being no point of reference.</p>

      <p>In addition to the standalone Manage Tags window, the
      tagging system has also been integrated into the Editor as
      the Tag Management Pane. The Tag Management Pane conveniently
      allows you to tag new entries as you write them. The Manage
      Tags window and the Tag Management Pane can only work with
      one entry at a time. Since RoboJournal equally distributes
      tagging functionality through the classic Manage Tags window
      and the Editor itself (to the point of literally using the
      same interface for both), it does not matter which method you
      use to tag your entries since both ways produce identical
      results.</p>

      <h3 id="Best">Best Practices</h3>

      <p>RoboJournal's tagging system allows you to assign one or
      more descriptive labels to an entry. Once declared, a new tag
      becomes available to the entire journal; you can apply all
      existing tags to all entries as you see fit. However, each
      tag can only be used once in any given entry. RoboJournal
      does not currently make tagging suggestions based on entry
      content but that may change in future releases.</p>

      <p>In all cases, you should assign tags based on entry
      content and/or subject matter because RoboJournal's tagging
      system is designed to categorize by topic. For instance, all
      car-related entries could be tagged with "car" or "vehicle"
      but not "pet". Ultimately, tag assignment is a matter of
      common sense. Since any given entry can address multiple
      subjects, it is typical for most entries to have several
      different tags.</p>

      <p>RoboJournal supports the use of multi-word tags and there
      is no real set limit on how many tags can be assigned to each
      entry or how many tags the journal can hold. However, the
      tagging system is most effective when tags are short in
      length, broad (but not overly broad) in scope, and
      appropriate in number to the size and diversity of the
      journal. In other words, you should only declare a new tag if
      your journal's subject matter requires it since tags are
      meant to be shared between entries. When you search for all
      instances of a specific tag, RoboJournal displays all entries
      that currently have that tag assigned to them.</p>

      <p>New tags should only be created if all of the existing
      tags are inapplicable to an entry's content or subject. When
      you define a new tag, you should expect to eventually use it
      more than once. Tags that are only used once in an entire
      journal are practically useless because they provide only one
      result during searches (and the affected entry probably would
      have had other tags assigned to it anyway).</p>

      <h3 id="Accessing">Accessing the Tagging Interface
      (Standalone)</h3>

      <p>Although RoboJournal now allows you to tag entries
      directly from the Editor, the "classic" standalone Manage
      Tags window continues to be an important feature. The main
      advantage offered by the standalone feature is speed; rather
      than requiring you to open an entry in the editor to alter
      its tag data, the Manage Tags window presents a stripped-down
      user interface to allow you to see which tags are active,
      apply new tags, or clear active ones as quickly as possible.
      The Manage Tags window is therefore best suited to situations
      where you must tag many entries at once during one session
      (as is the case whenever the Tag Reminder window is
      triggered).</p>

      <p>The following procedure allows you to access the Manage
      Tags window from the RoboJournal main window (assuming a
      connection is active at the time). The standalone Manage Tags
      window can also be invoked from the Tag Reminder window
      (consult the <a href="#tag_reminder">"Tag Reminder
      Window"</a> section for details).</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Click to select the entry you wish to tag (indicated by
        the large oval in Figure 1) from the Timeline on the
        RoboJournal main window. <img alt="Figure 1" src=
        "img/screens/mw_tag1.png" class="screenshot" height="589"
        width="750"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 1: Select the
        entry you wish to tag and click the <strong>Manage
        Tags</strong> toolbar button.</span> <span class=

        class="screenshot" height="426" width="476">Figure 2: The
        standalone tag window is also accessed through the Tag
        Reminder window that is displayed whenever RoboJournal
        detects untagged entries.</span></li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar button
        (as shown in the small circle in Figure 1). Alternatively,
        click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> button (Figure 2)
        after selecting an entry from the Tag Reminder window. In
        either instance, the Manage Tags window is
        displayed:<img alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/mw_tag2.png"
        class="screenshot" height="589" width="750"><span class=
        "caption">Figure 3: The Manage Tags window is always
        superimposed over the main window.</span></li>

        <li>Make all necessary changes (consult <a href=
        "#Assigning">"Applying and Removing Tags"</a> for details).
        The <strong>Apply</strong> button near the bottom of the
        window is unlocked after you have made at least one
        change.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Apply</strong> button to commit the
        changes (or click <strong>Cancel</strong> to abort the
        changes you have made).</li>

        <li>The <strong>OK</strong> button unlocks once you have
        saved your changes. Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the
        Manage Tags window.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> The Manage Tags window is always
        superimposed over the main window under normal
        circumstances. However, screenshots of the Manage Tags
        window in the following sections of this documentation omit
        the main window for the sake of simplicity.
      </div>

      <h3 id="L180">Accessing the Tagging Interface (From the
      Editor)</h3>

      <p>As previously stated, the tagging system has been fully
      integrated into the Editor for the sake of convenience. This
      new design allows you to apply tags to an entry as you write.
      This easy access to the tagging system is meant to get you
      into the habit of tagging entries in advance instead of
      allowing untagged entries to accumulate in your journal.</p>

      <p>The following procedure assumes you have already opened
      the Editor to write a new entry or modify an existing
      one:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar button
        (indicated by the red circle in Figure 4) in the Editor
        window. Alternatively, you can click and drag the Tag
        Management Pane splitter to the left (RoboJournal exerts a
        small degree of resistance to prevent accidental expansion
        or collapse) to expand it. RoboJournal allows the pane to
        expand once you have dragged the splitter far enough to the
        left to overcome resistance: <img alt="Figure 4" src=
        "img/screens/editor_tag1.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "574" width="688"><span class="caption">Figure 4: You can
        expand the Tag Management Pane by clicking the circled
        <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar button <em>or</em> by
        dragging the Tag Management Pane splitter (shown in red) to
        the left.</span></li>

        <li>Once triggered, the Tag Management Pane expands itself
        and allows you to access the tag data (if any) for the
        current entry:<img alt="Figure 5" src=
        "img/screens/editor_tag2.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "574" width="688"><span class="caption">Figure 5:
        RoboJournal allows you to apply tags to an entry before you
        save changes to it.</span></li>

        <li>Make all necessary changes (consult <a href=
        "#Assigning">"Applying and Removing Tags"</a> for
        details).</li>

        <li>(Optional) Collapse the Tag Management Pane by toggling
        the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar button or by
        dragging the splitter back to the far right of the Editor
        window. Under the second method, the pane collapses itself
        once you have dragged the splitter far enough to overcome
        its resistance.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The Tag Management Pane always limits itself to a maximum
      width no matter how large the Editor window is. However, the
      width increases to compensate for larger buttons if toolbar
      button text labels are enabled in RoboJournal
      Preferences.</p>

      <p>Unlike the standalone tag management window, the Editor's
      Tag Management Pane does not require you to manually commit
      changes to an entry's tag data. RoboJournal automatically
      saves/updates the current entry's tags when you post a new
      entry or save changes to an existing one.</p>

      <h2 id="L7841">The <strong>Tag Menu</strong> and
      <strong>Toggle Filtering</strong> Menu</h2>

      <p>In version 0.5 and later, RoboJournal's tagging system has
      been completely redesigned to be much more straightforward
      and intuitive. The new interface is intended to streamline
      the task of applying or removing tags from entries; instead
      of adding tags one at a time from a drop-down list (as was
      the case in older versions) the new system makes adding tags
      to entries as simple as checking items from a list of all
      available tags.</p>

      <p>The original tag interface design with its individual
      buttons was impractical for integration into the Editor
      window. Instead, RoboJournal 0.5 (and later) utilizes a
      menu-based system to prevent user interface overcrowding,
      especially when <a href=
      "preferences.html#global_preferences">toolbar button
      labels</a> are enabled. Under this new design, most
      tag-related functionality is contained within the tag menu.
      You can access the tag menu at any time by clicking the
      <strong>Tag Menu</strong> toolbar button:<img alt="Figure 6"
      src="img/screens/tag_menu.png" width="333" height="397"
      class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: The Tag
      Menu toolbar button displays a drop-down list containing most
      of RoboJournal's tag-related functionality.</span></p>

      <p>The following table addresses each item on the tag
      menu:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <col>
        <col>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="left"><a href="#Declaring">Declare new
            tag</a></td>

            <td class="right">This option allows you to add a new
            tag to the Available Tags list.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left"><a href="#L396">Strip all
            tags</a></td>

            <td class="right">This feature purges all tag data from
            the current entry.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Auto-tag entry (experimental)</td>

            <td class="right">Auto-tagging is an experimental
            feature that causes RoboJournal to assign tags based on
            the contents of the current entry's body text.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left"><a href="#L310">Revert Tags</a></td>

            <td class="right">This feature reverts all tag changes
            you have made.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The <a href="#L1619">Toggle Filtering</a> menu is
      displayed by clicking the down arrow immediately to the right
      of the <strong>Toggle Filtering</strong> button (Figure 7).
      The menu only contains the <strong>Clear Tags</strong> list
      item, which erases the current search pattern in the
      <strong>Filter Tags</strong> field.<img alt="Figure 7" src=
      "img/screens/toggle_filtering_menu.png" width="333" height=
      "397" class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 7:
      The Toggle Filtering menu contains items specifically related
      to tag filtering.</span></p>

      <h2 id="Declaring">Declaring a New Tag</h2>

      <p>Journals are deliberately created with no pre-existing tag
      data. RoboJournal leaves tag designation up to you because
      each journal is unique (therefore making it impossible to
      successfully anticipate your needs with a set of pre-defined
      tags) and you would know best about what is required. Once
      defined, each new tag becomes available to the entire
      journal.</p>

      <p>As stated in the previous section, nearly any word can be
      used as a tag but it is always best to use short one-word
      tags that are applicable to several entries. The only
      reserved word you may <em>not</em> use for a tag under any
      circumstances is any variant of "Null" (i.e. null, Null,
      NULL, etc.) because that word has special properties in the
      RoboJournal tagging system. "Null" is a type of invisible tag
      that is used for entries that were previously tagged but
      currently have no tag data assigned to them (brand-new
      entries that have never been tagged are treated differently).
      Entries tagged with "Null" produce a response of, "No tags
      for this post" in the main window's Entry Output Pane.
      RoboJournal produces an error message if you attempt to
      declare "Null" as a tag.</p>

      <p>The following procedure demonstrates how to declare a new
      tag in RoboJournal. The process is exactly the same for the
      standalone Manage Tags window and the Editor's Tag Management
      Pane (the screenshots show the Manage Tags window for the
      sake of simplicity)</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Click the <strong>Define Tag</strong> button on the
        Manage Tags window.<img alt="Figure 8" src=
        "img/screens/define_tag1.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "397" width="333"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 8: The
        <strong>Define Tag</strong> toolbar button launches a text
        prompt that allows you to define a new tag.</span></li>

        <li>RoboJournal displays the <strong>Enter the new
        tag:</strong> dialog. Enter the new tag into the text
        box:<img alt="Figure 9" src="img/screens/define_tag2.png"
        class="screenshot" height="396" width="333"><span class=
        "caption_wide">Figure 9: Enter the new tag into the
        provided text box.</span></li>

        <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button in the
        <strong>Enter the new tag:</strong> dialog to continue (or
        click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button to abort).</li>

        <li>RoboJournal adds the new tag to the very top of the
        Available Tags list and automatically selects it:<img alt=
        "Figure 10" src="img/screens/define_tag3.png" class=
        "screenshot" height="397" width="333"><span class=
        "caption">Figure 10: Newly-defined tags are inserted at the
        top of the list and are marked with a green plus-sign
        indicator.</span></li>
      </ol>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> Newly-defined tags are not permanent
        until they have been assigned to at least one entry.
        Therefore, you should not define a new tag until you
        actually need it (otherwise it will be discarded once you
        close the Manage Tags window).
      </div>

      <h2 id="Assigning">Applying or Removing Tags</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal's tagging interface has been revamped in
      version 0.5 to make applying or removing tags as simple as
      possible. The old menu-based interface from 0.4.1 and earlier
      has been deprecated in favor of a checkbox-based system.
      Every available tag in the journal is represented as a list
      item with a checkbox next to it. For ease of identification,
      active (checked) tags are shown in bold, colored font. The
      specific color used for active tags depends on your operating
      system; RoboJournal uses your system-level selected text
      background color as a base and then darkens it slightly to
      improve contrast and readability.</p>

      <p>To apply a tag to an entry, click once on the
      corresponding list item (the box to the left of the tag name
      checks itself automatically):<img alt="Figure 11" src=
      "img/screens/apply_tag.png" class="screenshot-noshadow"
      height="291" width="698"><span class="caption">Figure 11:
      Clicking an inactive tag in the list applies that tag to the
      current entry.</span></p>

      <p>Each time the Manage Tags window or the Editor is
      displayed, RoboJournal automatically marks all active tags so
      you will know which ones are already in use. To remove a tag
      from an entry, simply click the appropriate list item once
      (the checkbox clears itself automatically):<img alt=
      "Figure 12" src="img/screens/remove_tag.png" class=
      "screenshot-noshadow" height="291" width="698"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 12: Clicking an active tag (shown by the red
      circle) removes that tag from the current entry.</span></p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> To apply or remove a tag, you must
        click the text in the appropriate row instead of clicking
        the checkbox itself.
      </div>

      <h2 id="L306">Other Tag-Related Features</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal 0.5 offers new features that are designed as
      safety features or allow you to do bulk operations much more
      quickly.</p>

      <h3 id="L310">Revert Tags</h3>

      <p>The Revert Tags feature provides a way to immediately undo
      all the changes you have made to an entry's tags up until the
      time you commit the changes (i.e. before you click the
      <strong>Apply</strong> button in the standalone Manage Tags
      window <em>or</em> you save the entry that is currently open
      in the Editor). The Revert Tags feature works by resetting
      the tag list with the data that is currently saved in the
      database. RoboJournal refers to all unsaved tag changes as
      the "history".</p>

      <p>Since reverting changes requires the history to contain at
      least one change to undo, the <strong>Revert Tags</strong>
      toolbar button is always kept locked&mdash;as shown in Figure
      1&mdash;until some other action (like applying or removing a
      tag) triggers a history change. Clicking the
      <strong>Apply</strong> button in the standalone Manage Tags
      window applies all changes. Once the new data has been saved,
      RoboJournal clears the history and locks the <strong>Revert
      Tags</strong> toolbar button once more because the previous
      tag data no longer exists.</p>

      <p>The following procedure assumes the Manage Tags window is
      already displayed or the Tag Management Pane is visible in
      the Editor:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>The <strong>Revert Tags</strong> menu item is locked by
        default. Making one or more changes to the current entry's
        tag data establishes a history, which causes the
        <strong>Revert Tags</strong> menu item to unlock.</li>

        <li>After you have established a history, click the
        <strong>Tag Menu</strong> to display the tag operations
        menu: <img style="width: 333px; height: 397px;" alt=
        "Figure 13" src="img/screens/revert_tags1.png" class=
        "screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 13: The
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Revert Tags</span> button
        unlocks itself after you have made at least one change to
        an entry's tag data.</span></li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Revert Tags</strong> menu item (shown
        in Figure 13).</li>

        <li>RoboJournal asks you to confirm your decision to
        discard all changes you made to the tag data. Click the
        <strong>Yes</strong> button to continue or click
        <strong>No</strong> to abort.</li>

        <li>If you chose to continue, RoboJournal restores the
        saved tags for the selected entry:<img alt="Figure 14" src=
        "img/screens/revert_tags2.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "397" width="333"><span class="caption">Figure 14: In this
        example, "tips" is no longer selected after you have
        reverted the entry's tags (compare with Figure
        13).</span></li>
      </ol>

      <p>RoboJournal only allows you to click the
      <strong>Cancel</strong> button (exiting the Manage Tags
      window without saving) because there are no changes in the
      history to apply after reverting the tags back to their
      original state.</p>

      <h3 id="L396">Strip Tags</h3>

      <p>RoboJournal's new Strip Tags feature allows you to quickly
      remove all tags from an entry if it ever becomes necessary to
      do so. The <a href="#L310">Revert Tags</a> feature can undo
      this operation. The following procedure assumes the Manage
      Tags window is displayed or the Tag Management Pane is
      visible in the Editor:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Click the <strong>Tag Menu</strong> toolbar button to
        display the list of tag operations. Once the list is
        visible, click the <strong>Strip all tags</strong> list
        item (circled in Figure 15):<img alt="Figure 15" src=
        "img/screens/strip_tags1.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "397" width="333"><span class="caption">Figure 15:
        Accessing the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Strip
        Tags</span> menu item on the Tag Menu.</span></li>

        <li>RoboJournal asks you to confirm your decision to strip
        all tags from the entry. Click the <strong>Yes</strong>
        button to proceed or click <strong>No</strong> to
        abort.</li>

        <li>If you chose to continue the operation, all tags are
        now unchecked:<img alt="Figure 16" src=
        "img/screens/strip_tags2.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "397" width="333"><span class="caption">Figure 16: The
        strip tags operation removes all tags from the current
        entry. Clicking the <strong>Apply</strong> button saves the
        changes.<br>
          If you are accessing the tags from the Editor, saving the
          current entry is equivalent to clicking the
          <strong>Apply</strong> button.</span>

          <p>Steps 4&mdash;5 are only applicable when you are using
          the standalone Manage Tags window. If you are completing
          this procedure through the Editor's Tag Management Pane,
          any changes to the tag data are not finalized until you
          save the current entry (closing the Editor without saving
          rejects all tag changes as well).</p>
        </li>

        <li>The <strong>Apply</strong> button unlocks itself once
        you have made changes to the tag data. To finalize the
        decision, click <strong>Apply</strong>. If you wish to undo
        the changes, click <strong>Cancel</strong> or use the
        Revert Tags feature.</li>

        <li>Clicking <strong>Apply</strong> unlocks the
        <strong>OK</strong> button. Click <strong>OK</strong> to
        close the Manage Tags window.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="L1619">Filtering Tags</h3>

      <p>Your journal is likely to accumulate a large number of
      tags over time. Since RoboJournal normally displays all
      available tags in the Available Tags list, finding a
      particular tag can prove difficult even though RoboJournal
      always sorts your journal's tags in alphabetical order.
      RoboJournal 0.5 (and later) addresses this problem by
      allowing you to filter the tags list to display only the tags
      that match certain criteria.</p>

      <p>The filtering system works by scanning the Available Tags
      list for tags that contain a user-defined string. This scan
      is care-insensitive and matches all tags that contain the
      specified pattern. Each time a matching tag is found,
      RoboJournal appends it to a list. Once all the tags have been
      scanned, RoboJournal displays the list of matching tags
      instead of the full Available Tags list. This feature allows
      you to find the desired tag(s) much more quickly because the
      list of matches is usually much shorter than the full list of
      tags.</p>

      <p>The following procedure assumes the Manage Tags window is
      displayed or the Tag Management Pane is visible in the
      Editor:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Click the <strong>Filter Tags</strong> field (indicated
        in Figure 14) to transfer focus to it:<img alt="Figure 17"
        src="img/screens/filter_tags1.png" width="333" height="397"
        class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 17: When
        empty and unfocused, the <strong>Filter Tags</strong> field
        displays "Filter Tags" as placeholder text.</span></li>

        <li>Once a cursor appears in the field, enter the text you
        wish to use as a filter. As you enter text, RoboJournal
        automatically updates the contents of the Available Tags
        field:<img alt="Figure 18" src=
        "img/screens/filter_tags2.png" width="333" height="397"
        class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 18:
        Once you have set a filter, RoboJournal only displays the
        tags that match.<br>
        For instance, the Available Tags list in Figure 15 displays
        tags that contain at least one occurrence of
        "ta".</span></li>

        <li>(Optional) Click to select the tags you wish to use
        from the filtered list.</li>

        <li>(Optional) Un-toggle the <strong>Toggle
        Filtering</strong> button (by clicking on it) to display
        the full Available Tags list again:<img alt="Figure 19"
        src="img/screens/filter_tags3.png" width="333" height="397"
        class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 19:
        Un-selecting the <strong>Toggle Filtering</strong> button
        clears the <strong>Filter Tags</strong> field and causes
        RoboJournal to display the full tag list again.</span></li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="tag_reminder">Tag Reminder Window</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal takes additional measures (starting in version
      0.4.1) to ensure that all entries in your journal are
      properly tagged because untagged entries are invisible to tag
      searches and therefore can only be found through pattern
      matching. The Tag Reminder window is essentially a "nag
      screen" that asks you to tag existing entries at the start of
      each session. The purpose of this feature is to encourage you
      to use the tagging system; the notification is deliberately
      designed to be annoying in the hopes that you will soon get
      in the habit of tagging new entries immediately after you
      write them in order to prevent the Tag Reminder window from
      being displayed at all.</p>

      <p>If RoboJournal finds any untagged entries, it adds them to
      a list and displays them on the Tag Reminder window
      immediately after login (the Tag Reminder window is
      <em>not</em> displayed if RoboJournal fails to find any
      untagged entries):<img alt="Figure 20" src=
      "img/screens/tag_reminder.png" class="screenshot" height=
      "396" width="476"><span class="caption">Figure 20: The Tag
      Reminder window is shown only if RoboJournal detects untagged
      entries.</span></p>

      <p>The Tag Reminder window list shows all entries that
      currently have no tag data. This is limited to entries that
      have never been tagged before. Entries that were tagged at
      some point and have subsequently had their tag data cleared
      (i.e. entries tagged with "Null") are <em>not</em> included
      in the search because RoboJournal assumes you had a reason
      for clearing the previous tag data. This search covers all
      entries in the journal from newest to oldest and ignores the
      current entry range limitation. As such, you may be asked to
      tag very old entries that are outside the visible entry range
      you specified in RoboJournal Preferences.</p>

      <p>You can click the <strong>Close</strong> button to
      postpone the tagging procedure. This hides the Tag Reminder
      window for the remainder of the session but it will be
      displayed again during the next login. You can
      <em>permanently</em> suppress the Tag Reminder window by
      unchecking the <strong>Display this notification during the
      next login (if necessary)</strong> checkbox before clicking
      the <strong>Close</strong> button. This prevents the Tag
      Reminder window from being displayed ever again even if the
      journal still contains untagged entries. (you can also
      suppress or re-enable the Tag Reminder window through
      <a href="preferences.html#global_preferences">RoboJournal
      Preferences</a> at any time).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can select any entry from the list and
      click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> button to apply tags
      to it (consult Figure 2 in the "<a href=
      "#Accessing">Accessing the Tagging Interface
      (Standalone)</a>" section for details). The <strong>Entry
      Title</strong> column in the list gives the title of an
      untagged entry while the value in the <strong>Date</strong>
      column provides a point of reference for the entry in
      question. After you tag each entry, the list automatically
      refreshes and the current count (<strong><em>x</em> entries
      need to be tagged</strong>.) indicator is reduced by one. The
      Tag Reminder window automatically closes after you have
      tagged every item on the list. Once cleared, the Tag Reminder
      window will not be displayed at the start of the next session
      (unless you introduce more untagged entries during the
      current session).</p>
