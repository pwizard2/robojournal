<h2 id="Tagging">Tagging Overview</h2>

<p>As a journal gradually increases in size over the term of months and years,
you are very likely to write about similar topics multiple times. If you are
not using a <a href="preferences.html#entry_settings">range limit</a> on such a
journal, related entries may be harder to find and/or track once the sheer
volume of entries is taken into account. While RoboJournal allows you to <a
href="search.html#pattern_search_procedure">search for an entry using a keyword
system</a>, it is far easier to use the built-in tagging system to keep related
entries together.</p>

<h3 id="Best">Best Practices</h3>

<p>RoboJournal's tagging system allows you to assign one or more descriptive
labels to an entry. Once declared, a new tag becomes available to the entire
journal; you may apply all existing tags to all entries as you see fit.
However, each tag may only be used once in any given entry. RoboJournal does
not currently make tagging suggestions based on entry content but that may
change in future releases. </p>

<p>In all cases, you should assign tags based on entry content and/or subject
matter because RoboJournal's tagging system is designed to categorize by topic.
For instance, all car-related entries could be tagged with "car" or "vehicle"
but not "pet". Ultimately, tag assignment is a matter of common sense. Since
any given entry may address multiple subjects, it is typical for most entries
to have several different tags.</p>

<p>RoboJournal supports the use of multi-word tags and there is no real set
limit to how many tags may be assigned to each entry or how many tags the
journal may hold. However, the tagging system is most effective when tags are
short in length, broad (but not overly broad) in scope, and appropriate in
number to the size and diversity of the journal. In other words, you should
only declare a new tag if your journal's subject matter requires it since tags
are meant to be shared between entries. When you search for all instances of a
specific tag, RoboJournal displays all entries that have had that tag assigned
to them in the past. </p>

<p>New tags should only be created if all of the existing tags are inapplicable
to an entry's content or subject. When you define a new tag, you should expect
to eventually use it more than once. Tags that are only used once in an entire
journal are practically useless because they provide only one result during
searches (and the affected entry probably would have had other tags assigned to
it anyway). </p>

<h3 id="Accessing">Accessing the Tagging Interface</h3>

<p>The Manage Tags window is designed to work with the currently-selected entry
in the Chronological Entry List. As such, using the tagging function requires
an active connection; the tag function is locked while RoboJournal is in
Default State due to there being no point of reference. Once the Manage Tags
window is visible, you may perform any type of tag-related maintenance on the
selected entry. The Manage Tags window can only work with one entry at a
time.</p>

<p>The following procedure allows you to access the Manage Tags window:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select the entry you wish to tag (indicated by the large oval in
    Figure 1) in the Chronological Entry List on the RoboJournal main window.
    <img alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_tag1.png" width="750" height="584"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 1: Select the entry
    you wish to tag and click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar
    button.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Manage Tags</strong> toolbar button (as shown in the
    small circle in Figure 1). The Manage Tags window is displayed:<img
    alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/mw_tag2.png" width="751" height="583"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The Manage Tags window
    is always superimposed over the main window.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> The Manage Tags window is always superimposed over the
main window under normal circumstances. However, screenshots of the Manage Tags
window in the following sections of this documentation omit the main window for
the sake of simplicity. </div>

<h2 id="Declaring">Declaring a New Tag</h2>

<p>Journals are deliberately created with no pre-existing tag data. RoboJournal
leaves tag designation up to you because each journal is unique (therefore
making it impossible to successfully anticipate your needs with a set of
pre-defined tags) and you would know best about what is required. Each new tag,
once defined, becomes available to the entire journal.</p>

<p>As stated in the previous section, nearly any word may be used as a tag but
it is always best to use short one-word tags that are applicable to several
entries. The only reserved word you may <em>not</em> use for a tag under any
circumstances is any variant of "Null" (i.e. null, Null, NULL, etc.) because
that word has special properties in the RoboJournal tagging system. "Null" is a
type of invisible tag that is used for entries that were previously tagged but
currently have no tag data assigned to them (brand-new entries that have never
been tagged are treated differently). Entries tagged with "Null" produce a
response of, "No tags for this post" in the main window's Entry Output Pane.
RoboJournal produces an error message if you attempt to declare "Null" as a
tag. </p>

<p>The following procedure demonstrates how to declare a new tag in RoboJournal
(the process assumes you have already displayed the Manage Tags window):</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>New Tag</strong> button on the Manage Tags window.<img
    alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/define_tag1.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 3: The <strong>New
    Tag</strong> button launches a text prompt that allows you to define a new
    tag.</span></li>
  <li>The <strong>Enter the new tag:</strong> dialog is displayed. Enter the
    new tag into the text box:<img alt="Figure 4"
    src="img/screens/define_tag2.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 4: Enter the new tag
    into the provided text box.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button in the <strong>Enter the new
    tag:</strong> dialog to continue (or click the <strong>Cancel</strong>
    button to abort).</li>
  <li>The new tag is added to the <strong>Available Tags</strong> list. You may
    now apply this tag to the current entry.<img alt="Figure 5"
    src="img/screens/define_tag3.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: Newly-defined tags are
    inserted at the top of the list and are marked with a green plus-sign
    indicator.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> Newly-defined tags are not permanent until they have been
assigned to at least one entry. Therefore, you should not define a new tag
until you actually need it (otherwise it will be discarded once you close the
Manage Tags window).</div>

<h2 id="Assigning">Assigning a Tag to an Entry</h2>

<p>Currently, a brand-new entry has no tag data associated with it immediately
after it has been written and posted to the database (the ability to tag
entries from the Editor may be added in a future release). As such, new entries
display a "This entry has not been tagged yet" message in the Entry Output Pane
on the main window as a reminder for you to tag the entry. Until an entry has
been tagged, it is essentially invisible to the tag search function (although
the entry may still be found through a pattern search). </p>

<p>The following procedure assumes that you have already selected the entry you
wish to tag and that the Manage Tags window is displayed:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the drop-down <strong>Available Tags</strong> list. The current
    list of tags is displayed:<img alt="Figure 6"
    src="img/screens/assign_tag1.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 6: The
    <strong>Available Tags</strong> list contains all tags currently used in
    the journal.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Apply Tag</strong> button to add the tag to the
    entry.<img alt="Figure 7" src="img/screens/assign_tag2.png" width="405"
    height="273" class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 7: The
    <strong>Apply Tag</strong> button assigns the currently-selected tag to the
    entry.</span></li>
  <li>The selected tag is displayed in the current tags box (unlabeled but
    shown within the red circle in Figure 8):<img alt="Figure 8"
    src="img/screens/assign_tag3.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 8: The large area to
    the left of the <strong>New Tag</strong> and <strong>Remove Tag</strong>
    button displays all tags currently assigned to the entry. </span> 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to add another tag to the entry (if necessary). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Apply</strong> button to save the current tags (the
    <strong>Apply</strong> button is locked after this step and stays locked
    unless you add or remove another tag). <img alt="Figure 9"
    src="img/screens/assign_tag4.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 9: The
    <strong>Apply</strong> button saves the current tag choices.</span></li>
  <li>The <strong>OK</strong> button is unlocked once the save process is
    finished. Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to close the Manage Tags
    window and return to the RoboJournal main window.</li>
</ol>

<p>The selected entry in the RoboJournal main window now has tags applied to
it:<img alt="Figure 10" src="img/screens/mw_tag3.png" width="750" height="584"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 10: The new tags are shown
immediately in the RoboJournal main window.</span></p>

<h2 id="Removing">Removing a Tag from an Entry</h2>

<p>RoboJournal allows you to remove tags from entries if necessary. Once an
entry has been stripped of all tags, it is automatically tagged with "Null" (as
described in the <a href="#Declaring">Declaring a New Tag</a> section).
Removing all tags from an entry renders it invisible to tag searches but not
pattern searches.</p>

<p>RoboJournal does automatic maintenance/housekeeping by removing old tags
that are no longer used. Every time the Manage Tags window is displayed,
RoboJournal cross-references all tags in use throughout the journal and appends
every tag it finds to the <strong>Available Tags</strong> list (literally
rebuilding the list from scratch). Therefore, a tag is preserved from deletion
as long as it is being used by at least one entry.</p>

<p>The following procedure assumes that you have already selected the entry you
wish to tag and that the Manage Tags window is displayed:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select the tag you wish to remove (indicated by the red oval in
    Figure 11) from the current tags area. <img alt="Figure 11"
    src="img/screens/remove_tag1.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 11: All active tags
    for the current entry are represented by an orange tag icon next to the tag
    name.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Remove Tag</strong> button to continue.<img
    alt="Figure 12" src="img/screens/remove_tag2.png" width="405" height="273"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 12: The <strong>Remove
    Tag</strong> button is unlocked once you have made a selection.</span></li>
  <li>The tag you selected is removed from the list. Select and delete another
    tag (if necessary) or click the <strong>Apply</strong> button to save your
    actions.<img alt="Figure 13" src="img/screens/remove_tag3.png" width="405"
    height="273" class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 13: The
    <strong>Apply</strong> button is unlocked after the tag data has been
    changed.</span></li>
  <li>The <strong>OK</strong> button is unlocked after you have applied the
    changes you have made. Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to close the
    Manage Tags window and return to the RoboJournal main window.</li>
</ol>

<p>The entry you modified is automatically refreshed to display the changes you
just made to its tag data: <img alt="Figure 14" src="img/screens/mw_tag4.png"
width="750" height="584" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 14:
RoboJournal automatically displays all changes made to an entry (compare with
Figure 10).</span></p>

<h2 id="tag_reminder">Tag Reminder Window</h2>

<p>RoboJournal takes additional measures (starting in version 0.4.1) to ensure
that all entries in your journal are properly tagged since untagged entries are
effectively invisible to tag searches and may only be found through pattern
matching. The Tag Reminder window is essentially a "nag screen" that asks you
to tag existing entries at the start of each session. The purpose of this
feature is to encourage you to use the tagging system; the notification is
deliberately designed to be annoying in the hopes that you will soon get in the
habit of tagging new entries immediately after you write them in order to keep
the Tag Reminder window from being displayed at all. </p>

<p>If RoboJournal finds any untagged entries, it adds them to a list and
displays them on the Tag Reminder window immediately after login (the Tag
Reminder window is <em>not</em> displayed if RoboJournal fails to find any
untagged entries):<img alt="Figure 15" src="img/screens/tag_reminder.png"
width="476" height="396" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 15:
The Tag Reminder window is shown only if RoboJournal detects untagged
entries.</span></p>

<p>The Tag Reminder window list shows all entries that currently have no tag
data. This is limited to entries that have never been tagged before. Entries
that were tagged at some point and have subsequently had their tag data cleared
(i.e. entries tagged with "Null") are <em>not</em> included in the search
because RoboJournal assumes you had a reason for clearing the previous tag
data. This search covers all entries in the journal from newest to oldest and
ignores the current entry range limitation. As such, you may be asked to tag
old entries that are no longer visible because they are out of the entry range
you specified in RoboJournal Preferences. </p>

<p>You may click the <strong>Close</strong> button to postpone the tagging
procedure. This hides the Tag Reminder window for the remainder of the session
but it will be displayed again during the next login. You may
<em>permanently</em> override the Tag Reminder window by unchecking the
<strong>Display this notification during the next login (if necessary)</strong>
checkbox before clicking the <strong>Close</strong> button. This prevents the
Tag Reminder window from being displayed again even if the journal still
contains untagged entries at the next login (you may re-enable the Tag Reminder
window through <a href="preferences.html#global_preferences">RoboJournal
Preferences</a> at any time).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may select any entry from the list and click the
<strong>Manage Tags</strong> button to apply tags to it (consult the "<a
href="#Assigning">Assigning a Tag to an Entry</a>" section). The <strong>Entry
Title</strong> column in the list gives the title of an untagged entry while
the value in the <strong>Date</strong> column provides a point of reference for
the entry in question. After you tag each entry, the list automatically
refreshes and the current count (<strong><em>x</em> entries need to be
tagged</strong>.) indicator is reduced by one. The Tag Reminder window
automatically closes once the count indicator reaches zero. Once cleared, the
Tag Reminder window will not be displayed at the start of the next session
(unless you introduce more untagged entries during the current session). </p>
