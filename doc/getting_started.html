<h2 id="firstrun">First-Run Overview </h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores its settings in configuration files. Instead of sharing
the same settings for all users on the system, each user has a .robojournal
folder containing a robojournal.ini configuration file in his or her home
directory. This design allows each user to customize the same installation of
RoboJournal to his or her own specifications.</p>

<p>RoboJournal automatically initiates first-run mode if it can't find a valid
configuration file when it starts. This is guaranteed to happen the first time
you use RoboJournal after installing it. The purpose of first-run mode is to
establish the parameters used to govern RoboJournal's behavior. These
parameters are written to a configuration file immediately after you have
finished using the first-run tool. </p>

<p>You can force RoboJournal to reconfigure itself by deleting your current
configuration file. This action triggers first-run mode the next time you start
the program. You can also open your configuration file in a text editor (like
Vim or Notepad) and edit it manually. Direct editing is only recommended if you
need to make minor changes since it is easy to accidentally break your
configuration file. If you already have a pre-existing configuration file, you
can skip the first-run process altogether by placing that configuration file in
your home directory's .robojournal folder; RoboJournal will detect and use that
configuration file instead of initiating first-run mode.</p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> Older versions of RoboJournal (0.1–0.3) used a
different configuration file called robojournal.cfg. This old configuration
format has been officially deprecated. Newer versions of RoboJournal (0.4 and
later) initiate first-run mode the first time you use them even if a
robojournal.cfg file from an older version is already present. </div>

<p>The <strong>Welcome to RoboJournal</strong> dialog is displayed whenever
RoboJournal initiates first-run mode:</p>

<p><img alt="Welcome to RoboJournal dialog"
src="img/screens/welcome_to_robojournal.png" width="411" height="354"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 1: The Welcome to
RoboJournal dialog.</span></p>

<p>During first-run, you must decide whether you want to create a new (blank)
journal or configure RoboJournal to use an existing journal database. Select
the desired option on the Welcome to RoboJournal window and then click the
<strong>OK</strong> button to continue. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can abort the configuration process by clicking the
<strong>Cancel</strong> button. However, RoboJournal will continue to initiate
first-run mode each time you use it until a configuration file has been
created. </p>

<h2 id="create">Creating a New Journal Database</h2>

<p>The Journal Creator consists of a tabbed interface. Each tab must be
completed in full before a journal can be created. Completing this dialog
requires root-level access to the MySQL installation on the host you specify.
Without root access, you will not be able to create any journals. </p>

<p>The <strong>Set this new journal as my default</strong> checkbox is always
checked (and locked) during first-run. If you run the Journal Creator again at
a later time, this checkbox (then unchecked and unlocked) gives you the option
to replace the current default with the brand-new journal.</p>

<p>Complete the following procedure to create a brand-new, empty journal:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Select the <strong>Create a new journal database option</strong> on the
    <strong>Welcome to RoboJournal</strong> dialog and click the
    <strong>OK</strong> button. The <strong>Journal Creator</strong> dialog is
    displayed: <img alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/jc0.png" width="867"
    height="411" class="screenshot-noshadow"><span class="caption">Figure 2:
    Launching the Journal Creator during first-run.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>2. Basic Settings</strong> tab. The fields that govern
    essential parameters for the new journal are displayed:<img
    alt="Journal Creator: Basic Settings Tab" src="img/screens/jc2.png"
    width="414" height="393" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3:
    Journal Creator — <strong>Basic Settings</strong> tab.</span></li>
  <li>Enter a name for this journal database into the <strong>Journal
    name</strong> field. This name must be unique (no other database with the
    same name should exist on the indicated host). Short names are best; use
    underscores instead of spaces to separate words.</li>
  <li>Enter the host for this journal into the <strong>Journal host</strong>
    field (if necessary). The default value of "localhost" is used if this
    field is left blank. Localhost (also known as "127.0.0.1") refers to the
    current machine that RoboJournal is running on. If you intend to store
    RoboJournal <em>and</em> the database on the same machine, leave the
    <strong>Journal host</strong> field blank. Otherwise, enter the domain name
    or IP address of the machine on which the journal should be stored (that
    machine <em>must</em> have a working MySQL server process).</li>
  <li>Specify a username to associate with this journal and enter it into the
    <strong>Username</strong> field. You may <em>not</em> use "root" for the
    username!</li>
  <li>Choose a password to associate with the username you specified in the
    previous step. Enter this password in the <strong>Password</strong> and
    <strong>Repeat</strong> fields. The <strong></strong>contents of the
    <strong>Password</strong> and <strong>Repeat</strong> fields are always
    obscured for security purposes but the password indicator text notifies you
    when both passwords match. When both passwords are identical, the
    <strong>OK</strong> button for the Journal Creator is unlocked.</li>
  <li>Switch to the <strong>3. Authentication</strong> tab by clicking on it.
    The authentication-related options are displayed:<img
    alt="Journal Creator: Authentication" src="img/screens/jc3.png" width="414"
    height="393" class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 4:
    Journal Creator — <strong>Authentication</strong> tab.</span></li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>Root password</strong> for the host you specified in
    the <strong>Journal Host</strong> field on the <strong>2. Basic
    Settings</strong> tab. The contents of the <strong>Root password</strong>
    field are always obscured for security reasons.</li>
  <li>RoboJournal automatically sets a value of "3306" for the
    <strong>Port</strong> field; this is the standard port for MySQL servers.
    Make sure this value is correct for your particular situation and change it
    if necessary.</li>
  <li>Click the OK button on the <strong>Journal Creator</strong> dialog
    window. A confirmation dialog is displayed if the journal creation process
    was successful. 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> The next two steps are displayed <em>only</em> if
    RoboJournal is in first-run mode. Otherwise, RoboJournal preserves the
    user's full name and gender settings from the current configuration.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>A text input dialog is displayed. Enter your name (as you prefer it) and
    click the <strong>OK</strong> button. You may click the
    <strong>Cancel</strong> button if you wish to skip this step.<img
    alt="Figure 5" src="img/screens/set_name.png" width="336" height="128"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: This value sets the
    user's full name in the configuration file.</span></li>
  <li>A gender selection dialog is displayed. Select your gender by clicking
    the appropriate button.<img alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/set_gender.png"
    width="214" height="120" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6:

<p>RoboJournal is now successfully configured. For more information on how to

href="fundamentals.html">RoboJournal Fundamentals</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Assigning Permissions to a Database</h2>

<p>You can use the Journal Selector to locate databases that have been restored
from SQL dump files or migrated from other systems. Journals that you have
created with your own user account (and have never been migrated or restored)
can be located with relative ease. On the other hand, journals that have been
imported from other sources or restored from a backup usually require some
modifications before RoboJournal can even locate them.</p>

<p>In the same manner, remote journal databases usually require permission
changes before you can access them from your computer (even if the remote
database has never been restored from a backup or migrated from a different
server). This is a deliberate security measure intended to reduce the
likelihood of unauthorized remote tampering by restricting access to a few
"whitelisted" users while blocking all others. All permission changes to a
remote database require root-level access privileges and <em>must</em> be
performed on the same machine where the database you wish to use is stored. To
make the changes, you must either access the machine directly (if possible) or
connect to it via a remote access method like SSH or VNC.</p>

<h3 id="mysql_procedure">MySQL Procedure</h3>

<p>Restored databases are associated with the "root" user account by default
and are therefore inaccessible to regular users. You must make some changes to
the MySQL configuration in order to make a restored or migrated database easy
to use with RoboJournal. This process requires root-level access to the MySQL
console.</p>

<p>In the following procedure, assume that "sample_journal" represents an
imported database while "john_doe" represents the user account you intend to
associate the database with (and "123" is the password associated with the
john_doe account). You must obviously change these values to those appropriate
to your particular situation in order for this procedure to work properly in a
real-world context:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Gain access (physically or otherwise) to the machine that contains the
    journal you wish to use.</li>
  <li>Log in to the MySQL command line as root. The exact procedure varies by
    operating system: 
    <ul>
      <li>On Linux, open a terminal and type <span class="console">mysql -u
        root -p</span> and press Enter. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>On Windows, click the Start Menu and select <strong>All Programs »
        MySQL » MySQL Server 5.5 » MySQL 5.5 Command Line Client</strong>
        (the "5.5" may vary depending on which version you have installed but
        the location is likely the same).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Type the root password when prompted to do so (the password is hidden for
    security purposes as you type it). Press Enter.</li>
  <li>A <strong><span class="console">mysql&gt;</span></strong> command prompt
    is displayed if the login was successful.</li>
  <li>Create a user account for yourself (if necessary) with the with the <a
    href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-user.html">CREATE
    USER</a> command. You may skip this step if your user account already
    exists. 
    <ul>
      <li>Otherwise, type <span class="console">CREATE USER
        'john_doe'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123';</span> and press Enter
        (don't forget to substitute the real username, host, and password in
        the query). MySQL displays, <span class="console">Query OK, 0 Rows
        Affected</span> if the command was successful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the <a
    href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/grant.html">GRANT</a> command
    to give your user account (in this case, john_doe) permission to use the
    database you imported; type <span class="console">GRANT
    INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT ON sample_journal.entries TO
    'john_doe'@'localhost';</span> and press Enter (don't forget to substitute
    the real journal name, username, and host in the query). MySQL displays,
    <span class="console">Query OK, 0 Rows Affected</span> if the command was
    successful. 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> You should only grant permissions that are absolutely
    necessary (i.e. INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and SELECT) because additional
    permissions will not make your account work any better and can actually be
    dangerous to other databases. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">exit</span> and press Enter to disconnect from
    the MySQL command line.</li>
</ol>

<p>MySQL requires you to use a GRANT query to give yourself permission to view
and/or modify a remote journal database on your workstation. For instance,
assume that a journal database called "test" is stored on 192.168.2.1 and you
wish to access it through the "john_doe" user account on your workstation at
192.168.2.3. You would log in (as root) to the MySQL command interface on
192.168.2.1 and run, <span class="console">GRANT INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT ON
test.entries TO 'john_doe'@'192.168.2.3'</span> to give yourself permission to
access the journal. </p>

<p>You are ready to begin the journal selection procedure once you have
assigned the correct permissions to the database you wish to set as your
default.</p>

<h2 id="connect">Connecting to an Existing Journal Database</h2>

<p>RoboJournal's journal selection tool provides an easy way to select the
default journal during the first-run session. This tool allows you to specify
the username and password for a pre-existing account on a host machine (local
or remote). Once you have provided this information, RoboJournal displays all
databases associated with that specific user account. </p>

<p>In order to use this tool successfully, you <em>must</em> know the correct
username and password for the account you wish to access since RoboJournal
currently has no way of retrieving a full list of accounts from the host.
Furthermore, this tool only lists databases that are associated with the user
account you provide (all others are ignored). Before you use the Journal
Selector, you <em>must</em> <a href="#permissions">assign the correct user
permissions</a> to the database you wish to use or RoboJournal will be unable
to find it.</p>
<ol class="list">
