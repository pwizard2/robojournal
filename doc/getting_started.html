<h2 id="firstrun">First-Run Overview </h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores its settings in configuration files. Instead of sharing
the same settings for all users on the system, each user has a .robojournal
folder containing a robojournal.ini configuration file in his or her home
directory. This design allows each user to customize the same installation of
RoboJournal to his or her own specifications.</p>

<p>RoboJournal automatically initiates first-run mode if it can't find a valid
configuration file when it starts. This is guaranteed to happen the first time
you use RoboJournal after installing it. The purpose of first-run mode is to
establish the parameters used to govern RoboJournal's behavior. These
parameters are written to a configuration file immediately after you have
finished using the first-run tool. </p>

<p>You can force RoboJournal to reconfigure itself by deleting your current
configuration file. This action triggers first-run mode the next time you start
the program. You can also open your configuration file in a text editor (like
Vim or Notepad) and edit it manually. Direct editing is only recommended if you
need to make minor changes since it is easy to accidentally break your
configuration file. If you already have a pre-existing configuration file, you
can skip the first-run process altogether by placing that configuration file in
your home directory's .robojournal folder; RoboJournal will detect and use that
configuration file instead of initiating first-run mode.</p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> Older versions of RoboJournal (0.1â€“0.3) used a
different configuration file called robojournal.cfg. This old configuration
format has been officially deprecated. Newer versions of RoboJournal (0.4 and
later) initiate first-run mode the first time you use them even if a
robojournal.cfg file from an older version is already present. </div>

<p>The <strong>Welcome to RoboJournal</strong> dialog is displayed whenever
RoboJournal initiates first-run mode:</p>

<p><img alt="Welcome to RoboJournal dialog"
src="img/screens/welcome_to_robojournal.png" width="411" height="354"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 1: The Welcome to
RoboJournal dialog.</span></p>

<p>During first-run, you must decide whether you want to create a new (blank)
journal or configure RoboJournal to use an existing journal database. Select
the desired option on the Welcome to RoboJournal window and then click the
<strong>OK</strong> button to continue. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can abort the configuration process by clicking the
<strong>Cancel</strong> button. However, RoboJournal will continue to initiate
first-run mode each time you use it until a configuration file has been
created. </p>

<h2 id="create">Creating a New Journal Database</h2>

<p>The Journal Creator has been completely redesigned for RoboJournal 0.5. It
now consists of a highly modular "paged" design much like that of the
RoboJournal Preferences window that was introduced in RoboJournal 0.4. The
Journal Creator can be directly accessed during first-run or by clicking the
<strong>Journal Creator</strong> item in the <strong>Database</strong>
drop-down list on the RoboJournal main window. </p>

<p>Select the <strong>Create a new journal database</strong> option on the
Welcome to RoboJournal dialog and click the <strong>OK</strong> button to
launch the Journal Creator. Alternatively, you can select the <strong>Journal
Creator</strong> option from the main window's <strong>Database</strong>
drop-down list:<img alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/jc_launch.png" width="744"
height="371" class="screenshot-noshadow"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 2:
The Journal Creator can be invoked from the Welcome to RoboJournal window or
the main window's <strong>Database</strong> drop-down menu.</span> </p>

<p>In either case, the <strong>Journal Creator</strong> window is
displayed:<img alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/new_jc1.png" width="593"
height="515" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: Journal Creator
Overview page.</span> </p>

<p>The <strong>Set this new journal as my default</strong> checkbox is always
checked (and locked) during first-run. If you run the Journal Creator again at
a later time, this checkbox (then unchecked and unlocked) gives you the option
to replace the current default with the brand-new journal. The Journal Creator
always shows the Overview page by default. The Overview page helps you make a
decision about which database to use by explaining the main advantages and
disadvantages of each option.</p>

<h3 id="sqlite_journal">Creating a SQLite-based Journal</h3>

<p>More to come later-- keep this text as a placeholder.</p>

<h3 id="mysql_journal">Creating a MySQL-Based Journal</h3>

<p>RoboJournal requires root permissions to create a new MySQL-based journal
database. Be sure you have root-level database access before completing the
following steps:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Once the Journal Creator window is open, click the <strong>MySQL
    Journal</strong> option in the menu on the left side of the window. The
    MySQL Journal page is displayed:<img alt="Figure 4"
    src="img/screens/new_jc2.png" width="593" height="515"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: The Journal Creator
    populates several fields automatically based on your operating system
    settings.</span></li>
  <li>Change the values of the <strong>Journal name</strong> and
    <strong>Username</strong> fields if desired. RoboJournal automatically
    suggests default values based on your system-level username (which you log
    in as on Windows or Linux) to keep things consistent but some users may
    wish to change the default values to something else.</li>
  <li>Make up a password at least seven characters in length to go with your
    new username and enter it into the <strong>Password</strong> and
    <strong>Repeat</strong> fields. You must type your password twice to
    eliminate the possibility of typing mistakes. Once both password fields
    match, the <strong>OK</strong> button is unlocked and the Journal Creator
    assigns a strength rating to your password based on certain criteria. The
    strength ratings range from 0% (extremely weak) to 100% (extremely strong).
    In most situations, a strength rating of at least 75% means your password
    is strong enough to resist most attempts to crack it. <img alt="Figure 5"
    src="img/screens/new_jc3.png" width="593" height="515"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: The <strong>Password
    strength</strong> meter provides a visual indicator of password quality and
    resilience.</span> 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> Password strength is calculated according to length
    and diversity. A strong ( &gt;50%) password contains a randomized mixture
    of glyphs (upper and lowercase letters, integers, and symbols) and no
    dictionary words. RoboJournal adds points to the score for long passwords
    and the inclusion of all glyph varieties but docks points for adjacent
    glyphs of the same type (two or more letters, numbers, or symbols in a row)
    and repeating glyphs (two or more instances of the same character). If you
    need help creating strong passwords, tools like <a
    href="http://www.strongpasswordgenerator.com">Strong Password Generator</a>
    or <a
    href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Password-Managers-Generators/Randompass.shtml">Randompass</a>
    can produce an unlimited number of suitable glyph combinations.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Adjust the values in the <strong>Hostname</strong> and
    <strong>Port</strong> fields if necessary. Leaving these fields blank
    causes RoboJournal to use the built-in placeholder values ("localhost" for
    <strong>Hostname</strong> and "3306" for <strong>Port</strong>).</li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>Root password</strong> for the server you specified in
    the <strong>Hostname</strong> field. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button on the Journal Creator window. If
    your password strength is less than 50% and confirmation dialogs <a
    href="preferences.html#global_preferences">are enabled</a>, RoboJournal
    issues a warning and requires you to verify your decision to use a weak
    password. <img alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/new_jc4.png" width="585"
    height="518" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: The MySQL
    Page completely filled out.</span> 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> The next two steps are displayed <em>only</em> if
    RoboJournal is in first-run mode. Otherwise, RoboJournal preserves the
    user's full name and gender settings from the current configuration.<br>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>A text input dialog is displayed. Enter your name (as you prefer it) and
    click the <strong>OK</strong> button. You can click the
    <strong>Cancel</strong> button if you wish to skip this step. Skipping this
    step causes RoboJournal to use your username (instead of your full name) as
    an identifier in the Entry Output Pane's header area.<img alt="Figure 5"
    src="img/screens/set_name.png" width="336" height="128"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: This value sets the
    user's full name in the configuration file.</span></li>
  <li>A gender selection dialog is displayed. Select your gender by clicking
    the appropriate button.<img alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/set_gender.png"
    width="214" height="120" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6:
    The gender selection dialog determines which avatar icon is used while a
    connection is active.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Once the configuration file has been created and there is at least one
journal on the host, RoboJournal ceases to operate in first-run mode and is now
ready to be used normally. For more information on how to use core RoboJournal
functionality, refer to the <a href="fundamentals.html">RoboJournal
Fundamentals</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="permissions">Assigning Permissions to a Database</h2>

<p>You can use the Journal Selector to locate databases that have been restored
from SQL dump files or migrated from other systems. Journals that you have
created with your own user account (and have never been migrated or restored)
can be located with relative ease. On the other hand, journals that have been
imported from other sources or restored from a backup usually require some
modifications before RoboJournal can even locate them. </p>

<p>In the same manner, remote journal databases usually require permission
changes before you can access them from your computer (even if the remote
database has never been restored from a backup or migrated from a different
server). This is a deliberate security measure intended to reduce the
likelihood of unauthorized remote tampering by restricting access to a few
"whitelisted" users while blocking all others. </p>

<h3 id="assign_permissions">Assign Permissions Extension</h3>

<p>RoboJournal 0.5 introduces the Assign Permissions extension to the Journal
Selector. This new feature greatly simplifies the process of associating an
existing database with your own user account and is intended to be a
replacement for the old <a href="#mysql_procedure">MySQL Manual Procedure</a>
(which required you to access the MySQL command line interface directly). The
Assign Permissions extension is also the easiest way to create a user account
for yourself if one does not already exist on the host server. </p>

<p>You need root-level database access in order to change database permissions
and create user accounts, so make sure you have all required clearance before
you begin. The Assign Permissions extension should be used whenever it is
necessary to grant permissions to a database. For instance, migrated or
restored databases are usually owned by the root user; all other user accounts
(and therefore RoboJournal) are unable to access or modify such databases until
the necessary access permissions have been granted.</p>

<p>The Assign Permissions extension is initiated by clicking the <strong>Assign
Permissions</strong> button on the Journal Selector window:<img alt="Figure 7"
src="img/screens/assign_permissions1.png" width="545" height="462"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7: The Assign Permissions
window is accessed through the Journal Selector.</span></p>

<p>The Assign Permissions window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 8"
src="img/screens/assign_permissions2.png" width="354" height="412"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 8: The Assign Permissions
window immediately after launch. </span></p>

<p>Since it is an extension to the Journal Selector (rather than being an
independent module), the Assign Permissions extension inherits its database
mode from the current setting of the Journal Selector's
<strong>Database</strong> field. For instance, the Assign Permissions extension
starts in MySQL mode if the Journal Creator is configured to work with MySQL
databases at the time. The current mode is displayed in the Assign Permissions
window title bar (i.e. "Assign Permissions - MySQL"). It is impossible to
switch database modes without first changing the current backend on the Journal
Selector window and then re-initializing the Assign Permissions extension.</p>

<p>Certain fields on the Assign Permissions window can never be cleared.
Instead, they use placeholder text as default values that represent the most
common/most likely values for the field in question in typical scenarios.
Placeholder text is displayed when the affected fields would otherwise be
empty. Placeholder text is differentiated from standard text by its lighter
color (gray instead of black). </p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Change the contents of the <strong>Hostname</strong> and
    <strong>Port</strong> fields in the <strong>Database Settings</strong>
    group (if necessary). The <strong>Hostname</strong> field refers to the
    server where the database you wish to use is stored while
    <strong>Port</strong> determines which connection port RoboJournal should
    use during database transactions. The port you should use depends on how
    your server is configured but it is usually "3306" on MySQL servers.
    Leaving these fields blank causes RoboJournal to use the placeholder values
    for that particular database type.</li>
  <li>Enter the <strong>Root password</strong> for the database server located
    at <strong>Hostname</strong> (the contents of the <strong>Root
    password</strong> field are obscured for security reasons). 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> As a security precaution, MySQL forbids remote root
    logins (i.e. using Computer #1 to log into the root account on Computer #2)
    unless you grant the necessary permissions beforehand. Consult the <a
    href="#mysql_procedure">MySQL Manual Procedure</a> for details.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Scan</strong> button to run a search. Since this
    connection is through the root-level account, <em>every</em> database on
    the host is added to the <strong>Select database</strong> drop-down list.
    This action causes the <strong>Grant Settings</strong> group to unlock
    since it is now time to bind one of these databases to a regular user
    account. The <strong>Scan</strong> button locks once the <strong>Select
    database</strong> list has been populated.</li>
  <li>Select the database you wish to associate with your account from the
    <strong>Select database</strong> drop-down list:<img alt="Figure 9"
    src="img/screens/assign_permissions3.png" width="354" height="412"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 9: Logging in through the
    Root account allows you to access every database on the server.</span></li>
  <li>The next three steps determine which user account the selected database
    should be bound to. If you already have an account, enter your username
    into the <strong>Username</strong> field in the <strong>Grant
    Settings</strong> group. To create a new user account, make up a username
    and enter it into the <strong>Username</strong> field at this time.</li>
  <li>Enter the password that goes with your username into the
    <strong>Password</strong> field (the contents of the
    <strong>Password</strong> field are obscured for security reasons). If you
    wish to create a new user account, make up a password and enter it into the
    <strong>Password</strong> field now.</li>
  <li>Enter the correct hostname for your user account into the <strong>User
    host</strong> field (if necessary). Leaving the field blank causes
    RoboJournal to use the placeholder value ("localhost"). The User host value
    is only important if you intend to access your journal from a remote
    location. If this is the case, enter the hostname of the remote terminal
    into the field. For instance, you should enter "192.168.2.4" into the field
    if your journal database is stored on 192.168.2.3 and you wish to access it
    from the computer at 192.168.2.4. Enter "%" into the <strong>User
    host</strong> field if you wish to be able to access the database from
    <em>any</em> host (not recommended).</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue.<img alt="Figure 10:"
    src="img/screens/assign_permissions4.png" width="354" height="412"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 10: The <strong>OK</strong>
    button is unlocked once you have selected a journal to associate with your
    user account.</span> </li>
</ol>

<p>If the operation was successful, the database you selected is now associated
with your user account. From now on, it should be included in your list of
databases that is displayed whenever you log in with your account credentials
on the Journal Selector window. The <strong>Create user account if it does not
exist</strong> checkbox instructs RoboJournal to create a new user account for
you with the username and password you provided if an account matching those
credentials does not already exist. This option does <em>not</em> alter an
existing account's username or password; if your account exists, the current
database is simply added to the list of those associated with you, thereby
allowing you to access it through RoboJournal.</p>

<h3 id="mysql_procedure">MySQL Manual Procedure (deprecated)</h3>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> This section is preserved in the documentation for
legacy/failsafe purposes only. Most users should use the <a
href="#assign_permissions">Assign Permissions</a> extension instead since that
new feature accomplishes the same task much more easily. </div>

<p>All permission changes to a remote database require root-level access
privileges and <em>must</em> be performed on the same machine where the
database you wish to use is stored. To make the changes, you must either access
the machine directly (if possible) or connect to it via a remote access method
like SSH or VNC. Restored databases are associated with the "root" user account
by default and are therefore inaccessible to regular users. You must make some
changes to the MySQL configuration in order to make a restored or migrated
database easy to use with RoboJournal. This process requires root-level access
to the MySQL console.</p>

<p>In the following procedure, assume that "sample_journal" represents an
imported database while "john_doe" represents the user account you intend to
associate the database with (and "123" is the password associated with the
john_doe account). You must obviously change these values to those appropriate
to your particular situation in order for this procedure to work properly in a
real-world context:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Gain access (physically or otherwise) to the machine that contains the
    journal you wish to use.</li>
  <li>Log in to the MySQL command line as root. The exact procedure varies by
    operating system: 
    <ul>
      <li>On Linux, open a terminal and type <span class="console">mysql -u
        root -p</span> and press Enter. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>On Windows, click the Start Menu and select <strong>All Programs Â»
        MySQL Â» MySQL Server 5.5 Â» MySQL 5.5 Command Line Client</strong>
        (the "5.5" may vary depending on which version you have installed but
        the location is likely the same).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Type the root password when prompted to do so (the password is hidden for
    security purposes as you type it). Press Enter.</li>
  <li>A <strong><span class="console">mysql&gt;</span></strong> command prompt
    is displayed if the login was successful.</li>
  <li>Create a user account for yourself (if necessary) with the with the <a
    href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/create-user.html">CREATE
    USER</a> command. You may skip this step if your user account already
    exists. 
    <ul>
      <li>Otherwise, type <span class="console">CREATE USER
        'john_doe'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123';</span> and press Enter
        (don't forget to substitute the real username, host, and password in
        the query). MySQL displays, <span class="console">Query OK, 0 Rows
        Affected</span> if the command was successful.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use the <a
    href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/grant.html">GRANT</a> command
    to give your user account (in this case, john_doe) permission to use the
    database you imported; type <span class="console">GRANT
    INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT ON sample_journal.entries TO
    'john_doe'@'localhost';</span> and press Enter (don't forget to substitute
    the real journal name, username, and host in the query). MySQL displays,
    <span class="console">Query OK, 0 Rows Affected</span> if the command was
    successful. 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> You should only grant permissions that are absolutely
    necessary (i.e. INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and SELECT) because additional
    permissions do not make your account work any better and can actually be
    dangerous to other databases. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">exit</span> and press Enter to disconnect from
    the MySQL command line.</li>
</ol>

<p>MySQL requires you to use a GRANT query to give yourself permission to view
and/or modify a remote journal database on your workstation. For instance,
assume that a journal database called "test" is stored on 192.168.2.1 and you
wish to access it through the "john_doe" user account on your workstation at
192.168.2.3. You would log in (as root) to the MySQL command interface on
192.168.2.1 and run <span class="console">GRANT INSERT,DELETE,UPDATE,SELECT ON
test.entries TO 'john_doe'@'192.168.2.3';</span> to give yourself permission to
access the journal. You are ready to begin the journal selection procedure once
you have assigned the correct permissions to the database you wish to set as
your default.</p>

<p>If you need to enable remote root logins, execute <span
class="console">GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'[host]' IDENTIFIED BY
'[password]' WITH GRANT OPTION;</span> where [host] refers to the host you wish
to enable remote access from (for instance, 192.168.2.4) and [password]
indicates the current root password. Using the wild card (<span
class="console">%</span>) value for [host] is <em>extremely</em> dangerous
because it allows root access from any computer. After executing that query,
run <span class="console">FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</span> and quit the current MySQL
session. Next, open the MySQL configuration file (my.cnf) in a text editor and
comment out the line that says "bind-address = 127.0.0.1". Save the file and
quit. Remote root access will be enabled the next time the MySQL server starts.
</p>

<h2 id="connect">Connecting to an Existing Journal Database</h2>

<p>RoboJournal's journal selection tool provides an easy way to select the
default journal during the first-run session or any other time the default
journal needs to be changed. This tool allows you to specify the username and
password for a pre-existing account on a host machine (local or remote). Once
you have provided this information, RoboJournal displays all databases
associated with that specific user account. If you do not have a user account
at this time, you <em>must</em> use the <a href="#assign_permissions">Assign
Permissions extension</a> to create a new account and bind at least one journal
database to it before you can use the Journal Selector. </p>

<p>In order to use the Journal Selector successfully, you <em>must</em> know
the correct username and password for the account you wish to access since
RoboJournal currently has no way of retrieving a full list of accounts from the
host. Furthermore, this tool only lists databases that are associated with the
user account you provide (all others are ignored). Before you use the Journal
Selector, you <em>must</em> <a href="#permissions">assign the correct user
permissions</a> to the database you wish to use or RoboJournal will be unable
to find it.</p>

<p>Click to select the <strong>Connect to an existing journal database</strong>
option on the Welcome to RoboJournal dialog and click the <strong>OK</strong>
button. If RoboJournal is not in first-run mode, click the <strong>Journal
Selector</strong> option on the main window's <strong>Database</strong>
drop-down menu:</p>

<p><img alt="Figure 7" src="img/screens/js_launch.png" width="765" height="368"
class="screenshot-noshadow"><span class="caption">Figure 7: The Journal
Selector is launched via the Welcome to RoboJournal dialog <em>or</em> the

instances, the Journal Selector window is displayed: <img alt="Figure 8"

class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 8: The Journal Selector's

<p>The Journal Selector in RoboJournal 0.5 and later is designed to work with
multiple database types. This functionality is controlled by the
<strong>Database</strong> drop-down menu in the <strong>Backend</strong> group
and affects which window options are available at any given time. The Journal
Selector always starts in MySQL mode, which means it is configured to work with
MySQL databases by default. As such, the <strong>Connection and User Settings
group</strong> is unlocked and ready for input. The <strong>Browse</strong>
button in the <strong>Backend</strong> group is always locked while the Journal
Selector is in MySQL mode because file browsing functionality is inapplicable
to MySQL databases. On the other hand, switching to SQLite mode causes the
<strong>Connection and User Settings group</strong> to lock and the
<strong>Browse</strong> button to unlock because SQLite databases exist as
discrete files on your computer's hard drive.</p>

    If RoboJournal is <em>not</em> in first-run mode, you are asked to confirm
    your decision to replace your current default journal. Your previous
