<h1>Welcome to RoboJournal</h1>

<h2 id="what_is_robojournal">What is RoboJournal?</h2>

<p>RoboJournal is a cross-platform, database-driven application that allows you
to keep a journal/diary on your computer by means of an intuitive graphical
user interface. RoboJournal is designed to run on a variety of operating
systems, including Windows and practically any type of Linux. Support for Mac
OS X is the early planning stages and will hopefully be implemented before the
release of version 0.5. RoboJournal has this portability because it was
developed with the Qt Framework, a cross-platform development toolkit that runs
on nearly any computer system.</p>

<p>Unlike similar computerized journal tools that store user entry data in a
data file, RoboJournal stores all entry data "in the cloud" as a MySQL
database. These journal databases may be accessed directly through the server
machine, through another computer on the same LAN/WAN as the server, or even
remotely via the Internet. For instance, you can run RoboJournal on your
primary workstation while your journal database is stored on a server machine
in the same building or even in another country. You may even store RoboJournal
itself and your journal on the same computer and run RoboJournal in an entirely
closed ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Current Limitations</h2>

<p>At the moment, RoboJournal is <strong><em>not</em></strong> designed as or
intended to be a high-security program. Because of this, all journal data is
stored in the database in an unencrypted state. RoboJournal currently offers
some security; by means of account restrictions and a password, journals are
protected from all other unauthorized users <em>except</em> the root-level
database administrator (who has unconditional access to all MySQL databases
stored on the server whether they were created by RoboJournal or not). This
danger is minimal if you control the root account; if not, keep in mind that it
is possible for your journal to be read by others. </p>

<p>Support for on-the-fly encryption/decryption of journal content is planned
for a later version. Once this new design feature has been implemented, all
journal data will be permanently stored in an encrypted form and will be
decrypted into a readable state only when necessary. Not even the root user
will be able to unlock the journal content unless he or she has the correct
password required for decryption.</p>
