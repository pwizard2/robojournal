<h1>Welcome to RoboJournal</h1>
<h2 id="what_is_robojournal">What is RoboJournal?</h2>
<p>RoboJournal is a cross-platform, database-driven application that
allows you
to keep a journal/diary on your computer by means of an intuitive
graphical
user interface. RoboJournal is designed to run on a variety of
operating
systems, including Windows and practically any type of Linux.</p>
<p>Unlike similar computerized journal tools that store data as a file
on your
hard drive, RoboJournal stores all entry data "in the cloud" as a MySQL
database. These journal databases can be accessed directly through the
server
machine, through another computer on the same LAN/WAN as the server, or
even
remotely via the Internet. For instance, you can run RoboJournal on
your
primary workstation while your journal database is stored on a server
machine
in the same building or even in another country. You can even store
RoboJournal
itself and your journal on the same computer and run RoboJournal in an
entirely
closed ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Current Limitations</h2>
<p>At the moment, RoboJournal is <strong>not</strong> intended to be a
high-security program; all entry data in each journal database is
stored in an
unencrypted state. However, RoboJournal already offers some nominal
security—by
means
of account restrictions and a password, journals are protected from all
other
unauthorized users <em>except</em> the root-level database
administrator (who
has unconditional access to all MySQL databases on the server whether
they were
created by RoboJournal or not). This danger is minimal if you control
the root
account. If not, keep in mind that it is possible for other people to
read your journal. You can minimize this danger by storing your
journal(s) on a private MySQL
server
that you control.</p>
<p>Future versions of RoboJournal will fortify security by offering
support for
on-the-fly encryption and decryption of journal content. Under this
planned
security model, RoboJournal will store all data in an encrypted format
and decrypt it into a readable state only when necessary. Once
implemented,
this encryption will protect journal content from even the root
administrator (unless he or
she has the additional password required to unlock it).</p>
<h2>Help Topics</h2>
