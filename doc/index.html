<h1>Welcome to RoboJournal</h1>

<h2 id="what_is_robojournal">What is RoboJournal?</h2>

<p>RoboJournal is a cross-platform, database-driven application that allows you
to keep a journal/diary on your computer by means of an intuitive graphical
user interface. RoboJournal is designed to run on a variety of operating
systems, including Windows and practically any type of Linux.</p>

<p>Unlike similar computerized journal tools that store data as a file on your
hard drive, RoboJournal stores all entry data "in the cloud" as a MySQL
database. These journal databases can be accessed directly through the server
machine, through another computer on the same LAN/WAN as the server, or even
remotely via the Internet. For instance, you can run RoboJournal on your
primary workstation while your journal database is stored on a server machine
in the same building or even in another country. You can even store RoboJournal
itself and your journal on the same computer and run RoboJournal in an entirely
closed ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Current Limitations</h2>

<p>At the moment, RoboJournal is <strong>not</strong> intended to be a
high-security program. All journal data in the database is stored in an
unencrypted state. RoboJournal already offers some nominal security; by means
of account restrictions and a password, journals are protected from all other
unauthorized users <em>except</em> the root-level database administrator (who
has unconditional access to all MySQL databases on the server whether they were
created by RoboJournal or not). This danger is minimal if you control the root
account. If not, it is possible for other people to read your journal. This
danger can be alleviated by storing your journal(s) on a private MySQL server
that you control.</p>

<p>Future versions of RoboJournal will fortify security by offering support for
on-the-fly encryption and decryption of journal content. Under this planned
security model, all journal data is stored in an encrypted format and is
decrypted into a readable state only when necessary. Not even the root user can
unlock the journal content unless he or she has the correct password.</p>
