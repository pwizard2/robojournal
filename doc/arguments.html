      <h2 id="L1810">Overview</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal is capable of receiving additional arguments
      prior to launch. Many programs, especially those without
      graphical user interfaces, utilize arguments (also known as
      "switches" on some operating systems) to set program behavior
      in advance. These arguments are usually entered at a command
      line (i.e. Bash prompt on Linux/Unix or cmd.exe on Windows)
      or through a program launch window (such as the Run Command
      on Windows).</p>

      <p>Using arguments is inherently easier on Linux because
      command prompts are far more accessible. For instance,
      pressing the ALT and F2 keys simultaneously displays a Run
      Application window on common desktop environments like KDE or
      GNOME/MATE. On Windows XP and older, the "Run" option on the
      Start Menu was the easiest way to launch a program with
      custom arguments. On Windows 7 and later, the Run Command
      still exists but is hidden by default. As such, you must
      <a href=
      "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-happened-to-the-run-command">
      re-enable</a> (Windows 8 method <a href=
      "http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/where-is-run-command">
      here</a>) the Run Command before you can launch RoboJournal
      with custom arguments. Furthermore, most Windows programs are
      designed to be more user-friendly and therefore rely less on
      esoteric arguments in favor of more comprehensive controls in
      a program's user interface.</p>

      <h2 id="L1584">Date Override</h2>

      <p>Under normal conditions, RoboJournal applies today's date
      to all new entries created during the current <a href=
      "fundamentals.html#default">session</a>. However, you can
      force RoboJournal 0.5 (and later) to use an alternate date
      for new entries with a hidden but useful function that is
      activated prior to the current session. This function is
      universally referred to as the "date override" in this
      documentation. Requiring the user to enable the date override
      on a per-session basis is meant to be a safeguard against
      overuse.</p>

      <p>The date override allows you to set a false date of origin
      for entries written during a session in which date override
      is active. For instance, you can use the date override to
      make it appear as though an entry was written on 12/31/2013
      even if you actually wrote it on 1/1/2014. This can be useful
      in situations where your duties require you to keep a daily
      log. If you forget to write an entry for one or more days,
      you can use the date override to "fill in" the missing
      entries at a later time. Date override only affects new
      entries created during the session; existing entries keep
      their original dates if you edit them while date override is
      active.</p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal employs safety protocols
        that prevent users from using the date override to insert
        entries at a previous point in the timeline or at a future
        date. RoboJournal allows you to use the date override to
        insert a new entry <em>only if</em> the override date falls
        between the most recent item in the timeline (for instance,
        September 8th in Figure 1) and the current date.
      </div>

      <p>RoboJournal always displays a warning message after each
      login when date override is active:<img alt="Figure 1" src=
      "img/screens/date_override1.png" title="Figure 1" class=
      "screenshot" height="589" width="750"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 1: A notification/warning message is shown
      at the start of each connection while date override is
      active.</span></p>

      <h3 id="L1609">Proper Syntax</h3>

      <p>You can trigger the date override feature by appending
      <span class="console">--date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span> to
      the RoboJournal executable path (for instance, <span class=
      "console">C:\Program Files (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
      --date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span>). For the argument to be
      recognized, you must always include <em>one</em> space
      between the executable name ("../robojournal.exe" or
      "robojournal") and <span class=
      "console">--date-override</span>. The <span class=
      "console">mm-dd-yyyy</span> portion of the argument refers to
      the date you want to use (in mm/dd/yyyy format) instead of
      the current date. For instance, you could use <span class=
      "console">--date-override=01-01-2013</span> to set the
      current session's date to January 1, 2013.</p>

      <p>RoboJournal accepts and initiates the override if the
      specified date is valid; for instance, 02-28-2013 is
      acceptable while 02-30-2013 is not because February 30 does
      not exist in any year. RoboJournal ignores the date override
      argument and operates normally if the specified date is
      invalid and/or the argument syntax is incorrect. You can
      separate the month, day, and year values in the date with
      hyphens or forward slashes (but not a mix of both). The
      following sections demonstrate the correct syntax and usage
      for Windows and Unix-like operating systems (such as
      Linux):</p>

      <h4 id="L1622">Enabling Date Override on Windows</h4>

      <p>Windows does not accept the <span class=
      "console">--date-override</span> argument when the program is
      launched through a desktop or Start Menu shortcut. Therefore,
      the only way to initiate date override from Windows is
      through the Run Command window on the Windows Start
      menu:<img alt="Figure 2" src=
      "img/screens/date_override_win1.png" title="Figure 2" class=
      "screenshot" height="212" width="413"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 2: Under the current settings, RoboJournal's
      date override is set for September 3, 2013.</span></p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> Windows usually puts quotation marks
        around commands in the <strong>Open</strong> field,
        especially if they were added with the
        <strong>Browse</strong> button. You <em>must</em> remove
        the quotation marks for the date override command to be
        valid (i.e. <span class="console">C:\Program Files
        (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
        --date-override=09-03-2013</span> is correct while
        <span class="console">"C:\Program Files
        (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
        --date-override=09-03-2013"</span> is not).
      </div>

      <h4 id="L1653">Enabling Date Override on Unix/Linux</h4>

      <p>Enabling date override on Linux or any other type of
      Unix-like operating system (like Mac OS X) is extremely
      simple due to how those operating systems store executables.
      Since Unix-like operating systems usually store all installed
      applications&mdash;including RoboJournal&mdash;in a single
      folder (/usr/bin), there is no need to specify absolute
      pathnames when launching a program from the console.<br></p>

      <p>To start RoboJournal with date override enabled, open a
      terminal application (Konsole, XTerm, mate-terminal, etc.)
      and enter <span class="console">robojournal
      --date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span> at the command
      prompt:<img style="width: 664px; height: 460px;" alt=
      "Figure 3" title="Figure 3" src=
      "img/screens/date_override_linux.png" class=
      "screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: Launching
      RoboJournal through mate-terminal on Linux Mint 15 with the
      date override set to September 8, 2013.</span></p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can launch RoboJournal through the
      aforementioned Run Application window by pressing the ALT and
      F2 keys simultaneously (assuming you are running KDE, GNOME,
      MATE, or a similar desktop environment). The Run Application
      window's appearance varies depending on which desktop
      environment you are using at the time:<img style=
      "width: 498px; height: 175px;" alt="Figure 4" title=
      "Figure 4" src="img/screens/date_override_linux2.png" class=
      "screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: Launching
      RoboJournal (with date override enabled) through the Run
      Application window on Linux Mint 15.</span></p>

      <h2 id="L1062">Disable Safety Protocols</h2>

      <p>Starting in version 0.5, RoboJournal utilizes safety
      protocols that protect database integrity by preventing
      misure of the date override feature. If you invoke the date
      override by providing a date that is valid but is not truly
      logical, RoboJournal's safety protocols normally prevent you
      from adding new entries by disabling the <strong>Write in
      Journal</strong> toolbar button/menu item. RoboJournal
      considers a date to be logical <em>only</em> if it falls
      inbetween the most recent entry in the journal and the
      current date.</p>

      <p>The safety protocols usually prevent misuse of the date
      override feature but on rare occasions you may need finer
      control. The <span class="console">--no-safety</span>
      argument disables the date override safety protocols and
      allows you to write new entries whether the current override
      date is logical or not:</p>

      <p><img alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/date_override2.png"
      width="749" height="589" class="screenshot"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 2: Safety protocols have been disabled in
      this screenshot. The <strong>Write in Journal</strong> button
      is enabled even though the override date is one day later
      than the current system date (shown in the Windows Taskbar)
      and nearly a week ahead of the most recent entry in the
      journal (September 8).</span></p>

      <h3 id="L1079">Proper Syntax</h3>

      <p>The <span class="console">--no-safety</span> argument
      <em>must</em> be listed after the date override argument in
      order to be recognized:</p>

      <p>i.e. <span class="console">C:\Program Files
      (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe --date-override=mm-dd-yyyy
      --no-safety</span></p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> The <span class=
        "console">--no-safety</span> argument can be dangerous to
        database integrity when overused or misused. You should
        only invoke this feature when absolutely necessary and
        exercise extreme caution while it is active.
