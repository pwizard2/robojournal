<h2 id="L1810">Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal is capable of receiving additional arguments prior to launch.
These arguments are meant to be manually entered at a command line (i.e. Bash
prompt on Linux/Unix or cmd.exe on Windows) or through a program launch window
(such as the Run Command on Windows). </p>

<p>Invoking arguments is inherently easier on Linux because command prompts are
far more accessible. For instance, pressing the ALT and F2 keys simultaneously
displays a "Run Program" dialog on common desktop environments like KDE or
GNOME/MATE. On Windows XP and older, the "Run" option on the Start Menu was the
easiest way to launch a program with custom arguments. On Windows 7 and later,
the Run Command still exists but is hidden by default. As such, you must <a
href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-happened-to-the-run-command">re-enable</a>
(Windows 8 method <a
href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/where-is-run-command">here</a>)
the Run Command before you can launch RoboJournal with custom arguments.</p>

<h2 id="L1584">Date Override</h2>

<p>Under normal conditions, RoboJournal applies the current date to all new
entries created during that session. However, you can force RoboJournal 0.5
(and later) to use an alternate date for new entries with a hidden but useful
function that is activated prior to the current session. This function is
universally referred to as the "date override" in this documentation.</p>

<p>The date override allows you to set a false date of origin for entries
written during a session in which date override is active. For instance, you
can use the date override to make it appear as though an entry was written on
12/31/2013 even if you actually wrote it on 1/1/2014. This can be useful in
situations where your duties require you to keep a daily log. If you forget to
write an entry for one or more days, you can use the date override to "fill in"
the missing entries at a later time. Date override does not affect the dates of
entries that are edited during the session. </p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> The date override is convenient in situations where it is
necessary but it can also corrupt the entire database when used incorrectly.
The date override should only be applied to a new entry that will be the
<em><strong>most recent</strong></em> item in the timeline once it has been
saved. <strong><em>Never</em></strong> use the date override to insert a new
entry between other entries at a previous point in the timeline or at a future
date (doing either action always causes database corruption).</div>

<p>When the date override is active, RoboJournal always displays a warning
message after each login:<img alt="Figure 1"
src="img/screens/date_override1.png" width="749" height="590" title="Figure 1"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 1: A notification/warning
message is shown at the start of each connection while date override is active.
</span></p>

<h3 id="L1609">Proper Syntax</h3>

<p>You can trigger the date override feature by appending <span
class="console">--date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span> to the RoboJournal executable
path (for instance, <span class="console">C:\Program Files
(x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe --date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span>). The <span
class="console">mm-dd-yyyy</span> portion of the argument refers to the date
you want to use (in mm/dd/yyyy format) instead of the current date. For
instance, you could use <span class="console">--date-override=01-01-2013</span>
to set the current session's date to January 1, 2013. </p>

<p>RoboJournal accepts and initiates the override if the specified date is
valid; for instance, 02-28-2013 is acceptable while 02-30-2013 is not because
February 30 does not exist in any year. RoboJournal ignores the date override
argument and operates normally if the specified date is invalid and/or the
argument syntax is incorrect. You can separate the month, day, and year values
in the date with hyphens or forward slashes (but not a mix of both). The
following sections demonstrate the correct syntax and usage for Winows and
Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux):</p>

<h4 id="L1622">Enabling Date Override on Windows</h4>

<p>Windows does not accept the <span class="console">--date-override</span>
argument when the program is launched through a desktop shortcut. The only way
to initiate date override from Windows is through the Run Command window on the
Windows Start menu:<img alt="Figure 2" src="img/screens/date_override_win1.png"
width="413" height="212" title="Figure 2" class="screenshot"><span
class="caption">Figure 2: Under the current settings, RoboJournal's date
override is set for September 3, 2013.</span></p>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI: </strong>Windows usually puts quotation marks around commands in
the <strong>Open</strong> field, especially if they were added with the
<strong>Browse</strong> button. You <em>must</em> remove the quotation marks
for the date override command to be valid (i.e. <span
class="console">C:\Program Files (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
--date-override=09-03-2013</span> is correct while <span
class="console">"C:\Program Files (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
--date-override=09-03-2013"</span> is not).</div>
