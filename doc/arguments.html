<h2 id="L1810">Overview</h2>
<p>RoboJournal is capable of receiving additional arguments prior to
launch.
Many programs, especially those without graphical user interfaces,
utilize
arguments (also known as "switches" on some operating systems) to set
program
behavior in advance. These arguments are usually entered at a command
line
(i.e. Bash prompt on Linux/Unix or cmd.exe on Windows) or through a
program
launch window (such as the Run Command on Windows). </p>
<p>Using arguments is inherently easier on Linux because command
prompts are
far more accessible. For instance, pressing the ALT and F2 keys
simultaneously
displays a Run Application window on common desktop environments like
KDE
or
GNOME/MATE. On Windows XP and older, the "Run" option on the Start Menu
was the
easiest way to launch a program with custom arguments. On Windows 7 and
later,
the Run Command still exists but is hidden by default. As such, you
must <a
 href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-happened-to-the-run-command">re-enable</a>
(Windows 8 method <a
 href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/where-is-run-command">here</a>)
the Run Command before you can launch RoboJournal with custom
arguments.
Furthermore, most Windows programs are designed to be more
user-friendly and
therefore rely less on esoteric arguments in favor of more
comprehensive
controls in a program's user interface. </p>
<h2 id="L1584">Date Override</h2>
<p>Under normal conditions, RoboJournal applies today's date to all
new
entries created during the current <a href="fundamentals.html#default">session</a>.
However, you can force RoboJournal
0.5
(and later) to use an alternate date for new entries with a hidden but
useful
function that is activated prior to the current session. This function
is
universally referred to as the "date override" in this documentation.
Date
override can only be activated through program arguments because it has
the
potential to be dangerous; requiring the user to enter the date
override by
hand each time is meant to be a safeguard against overuse.</p>
<p>The date override allows you to set a false date of origin for
entries
written during a session in which date override is active. For
instance, you
can use the date override to make it appear as though an entry was
written on
12/31/2013 even if you actually wrote it on 1/1/2014. This can be
useful in
situations where your duties require you to keep a daily log. If you
forget to
write an entry for one or more days, you can use the date override to
"fill in"
the missing entries at a later time. Date override only affects new
entries
created during the session; existing entries keep their original dates
if you
edit them while date override is active.</p>
<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> The date override is convenient in situations
where it is
necessary but it can also corrupt the entire database when used
incorrectly.
The date override should only be applied to a new entry that will be
the
<em><strong>most recent</strong></em> item in the timeline once it has
been
saved. <strong><em>Never</em></strong> use the date override to insert
a new
entry between other entries at a previous point in the timeline or at a
future
date (doing either action always causes database corruption).</div>
<p>RoboJournal always displays a warning message after each login when
date
override is active:<img alt="Figure 1"
 src="img/screens/date_override1.png" title="Figure 1"
 class="screenshot" height="590" width="749"><span class="caption">Figure
1: A notification/warning message is shown at the start
of each connection while date override is active. </span></p>
<h3 id="L1609">Proper Syntax</h3>
<p>You can trigger the date override feature by appending <span
 class="console">--date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span> to the RoboJournal
executable
path (for instance, <span class="console">C:\Program Files
(x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe --date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span>).
For the
argument to be recognized, you must always include <em>one</em> space
between
the executable name ("../robojournal.exe" or "robojournal") and <span
 class="console">--date-override</span>. The <span class="console">mm-dd-yyyy</span>
portion of the argument refers to the date
you want to use (in mm/dd/yyyy format) instead of the current date. For
instance, you could use <span class="console">--date-override=01-01-2013</span>
to set the current session's date to January 1, 2013. </p>
<p>RoboJournal accepts and initiates the override if the specified date
is
valid; for instance, 02-28-2013 is acceptable while 02-30-2013 is not
because
February 30 does not exist in any year. RoboJournal ignores the date
override
argument and operates normally if the specified date is invalid and/or
the
argument syntax is incorrect. You can separate the month, day, and year
values
in the date with hyphens or forward slashes (but not a mix of both).
The
following sections demonstrate the correct syntax and usage for Windows
and
Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux):</p>
<h4 id="L1622">Enabling Date Override on Windows</h4>
<p>Windows does not accept the <span class="console">--date-override</span>
argument when the program is launched through a desktop or Start Menu
shortcut.
Therefore, the only way to initiate date override from Windows is
through the
Run Command window on the Windows Start menu:<img alt="Figure 2"
 src="img/screens/date_override_win1.png" title="Figure 2"
 class="screenshot" height="212" width="413"><span class="caption">Figure
2: Under the
current settings, RoboJournal's date override is set for September 3,
2013.</span></p>
<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI: </strong>Windows usually puts quotation marks around
commands in
the <strong>Open</strong> field, especially if they were added with
the
<strong>Browse</strong> button. You <em>must</em> remove the quotation
marks
for the date override command to be valid (i.e. <span class="console">C:\Program
Files (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
--date-override=09-03-2013</span> is correct while <span
 class="console">"C:\Program Files (x86)\RoboJournal\robojournal.exe
--date-override=09-03-2013"</span> is not).</div>
<h4 id="L1653">Enabling Date Override on Unix/Linux</h4>
<p>Enabling date override on Linux or any other type of Unix-like
operating system (like Mac OS X) is extremely simple due to how those
operating systems store executables. Since Unix-like operating systems
usually store all installed applications—including RoboJournal—in a
single folder
(/usr/bin), there is no need to specify absolute pathnames when
launching a program from the console. <br>
</p>
<p>To start RoboJournal with date override enabled, open a terminal
application (Konsole, XTerm, mate-terminal, etc.) and enter <span
 class="console">robojournal
--date-override=mm-dd-yyyy</span> at the command prompt:<img
 style="width: 664px; height: 460px;" alt="Figure 3" title="Figure 3"
 src="img/screens/date_override_linux.png" class="screenshot"><span
 class="caption">Figure 3: Launching RoboJournal through mate-terminal
on Linux Mint 15 with the date override set to September 8, 2013.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch RoboJournal through the aforementioned
Run Application window by pressing the ALT and F2 keys simultaneously
(assuming you are running KDE, GNOME, MATE, or a similar desktop
environment). The Run Application window's appearance varies depending
on which desktop environment you are using at the time:<img

enabled) through the Run Application window
