<h2 id="default">Default State</h2>
<p>RoboJournal is ready for regular day-to-day use once it has been <a
 href="getting_started.html#firstrun">properly configured</a> through
first-run
mode. When RoboJournal is started under normal conditions, the main
window is
displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="RoboJournal Main Window in Default State"
 src="img/screens/mainwindow_default.png" class="screenshot"
 height="589" width="753"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 1:
RoboJournal's main
window in "Default State".</span></p>
<p>The initial configuration of the main window (immediately after
starting the
program) is known as the "Default State" in this documentation. Most of
the
main window's functionality (except <strong>Connect</strong> and
<strong>RoboJournal Preferences</strong>) is locked while the program
is in the
Default State because the locked functions specifically affect the
current
journal; in other words, there is nothing for these functions to do
without an
active connection. Therefore, you must make a connection to unlock this
functionality.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy">Main Window Anatomy</h2>
<p>On a superficial level, RoboJournal's main window consists of two
large
areas bifurcated by a movable splitter object. The Chronological Entry
List
(Item 12 in Figure 2) is always located on the left side of the
splitter while
the Entry Output Pane (Item 18) is always on the right. The rest of the
window
contains a movable toolbar, a status bar, and the standard drop-down
File,
Edit, etc. menus common to most Windows programs. <br>
</p>
<p>RoboJournal's toolbar can be docked on the left, right, or top
margin of the
main window. The toolbar cannot be free-floated or discarded (although
it can
be temporarily hidden by selecting the appropriate option in the
<strong>Show</strong> sub-menu on the <strong>Window</strong>
drop-down menu).
You can change the location of the toolbar by dragging the toolbar
docking
widget to the position where you want the toolbar to be or by selecting
the
desired position from the <strong>Toolbar position</strong> sub-menu
on the
<strong>Window</strong> drop-down menu. For ease of identification, the
toolbar
docking widget is always on the far left side of the toolbar or on the
very top
if the toolbar is currently docked vertically (the docking widget's
appearance
may vary by operating system). Your mouse pointer changes to a
four-directional
arrow while it is hovering over the toolbar docking widget. The layout
automatically adjusts once the toolbar has been moved to a new
location. Be
advised that moving the toolbar this way is temporary; the only way to
permanently change the toolbar orientation is by selecting a different
default
position in <a
 href="preferences.html#global_preferences">RoboJournal
Preferences</a>. </p>
<p>The splitter object separates the Chronological Entry List from the
Entry
Output Pane and determines how much window space is allocated to each.
By
default, the splitter divides the RoboJournal main window roughly in
half on
the vertical axis, regardless of window size. If desired, you can drag
the
splitter bar left or right to shrink or grow the sizes of the
Chronological
Entry List and the Entry Output Pane. Moving the splitter all the way
left or
all the way right collapses the object on that side, rendering it
invisible.
The remaining object expands to fill the entire horizontal axis of the
window.
If you move the splitter bar to a new location, RoboJournal saves the
coordinates and automatically applies them to future sessions.
RoboJournal
reverts the splitter to the default position if the saved coordinate
data
becomes
unavailable for some reason.</p>
<p>The following diagram and table provide a complete explanation of
each
element in the main window layout. Each numbered item in Figure 2
corresponds
to the table row bearing the same number:</p>

<h2 id="connect">Making a Connection</h2>
<p>You must initiate a new connection before you can work with a
journal. A
connection creates a persistent link between the RoboJournal interface
and the
database you are currently working with. As such, all actions initiated
during
the session only affect the journal you are currently connected to.
RoboJournal
only supports one connection at a time; you must run multiple instances
of
RoboJournal if you need to work with more than one journal
simultaneously.</p>
<p>The following procedure establishes a new connection:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Connect</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
the small red circle in Figure 3). </li>
  <li>The New Connection dialog is displayed:<img alt="Figure 3"
 src="img/screens/login1.png" class="screenshot" height="590"
 width="753"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 3: New Connection Dialog
(in MySQL mode).</span>
    <div class="FYI"> <strong>FYI:</strong> The <strong>Host</strong>,
    <strong>Database</strong>, and <strong>Username</strong> fields on
the New Connection dialog are automatically populated with default
values if the <strong>Always suggest default values</strong> option is
enabled in the RoboJournal Preferences window. You can temporarily
override this functionality by unchecking the <strong>Use default
host/database</strong> and <strong>Use default user account</strong>
checkboxes on the New Connection dialog. <br>
    <br>
After doing so, the <strong>Host</strong>, <strong>Database</strong>,
and <strong>Username</strong> fields are cleared and made writable so
you can enter your own values. This override is only effective for the
current session; the next connection automatically reverts back to the
default values. You must <a href="preferences.html#mysql_settings_page">edit
the default settings</a> if you wish to make your override values
permanent.<br>
    <br>
Every text field in the New Connection dialog is automatically blank
and writable if RoboJournal is not configured to suggest default
values. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Enter the appropriate password into the <strong>Password</strong>
field (indicated by the large oval in Figure 3). The contents of the <strong>Password</strong>
field are always obscured for security reasons. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Figure 4" src="img/screens/mainwindow_connected_mode.png"
 class="screenshot" height="589" width="753"><span class="caption_wide">Figure
4: RoboJournal main window in Connected Mode.</span></p>
<p>RoboJournal attempts to make the connection using the values you
provided
once you have clicked the <strong>OK</strong> button in the New
Connection
dialog. Successfully establishing a connection takes RoboJournal out of
Default
State and causes it to enter Connected Mode (as shown in Figure 4). All
previously-locked program functionality becomes available while
RoboJournal is
in Connected Mode. However, the <strong>Connect</strong> button is
locked
during this time because it is currently impossible to have multiple
connections in a single instance of RoboJournal. </p>
<p>In RoboJournal version 0.4.1 (or newer), RoboJournal displays the <a
 href="tags.html#tag_reminder">Tag Reminder window</a> immediately
after login
if your journal contains any untagged entries. You are required to tag
the
entries in the list or close the Tag Reminder window before you can
access the
rest of your journal.</p>
<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal utilizes a "sanity check" mechanism
for
determining the compatibility of the database you are currently
attempting to
connect to. A database is considered to be "sane" if it matches a
predefined
table structure; this causes RoboJournal to recognize it as a valid
journal.
RoboJournal refuses to load any database that fails the sanity check. </div>
<h2 id="disconnect">Disconnecting</h2>
<p>You can disconnect at any time while RoboJournal is in Connected
Mode.
Disconnecting returns RoboJournal to a condition very similar to
Default State.
Once you have disconnected, you can make another connection or quit the
program. </p>
<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI:</strong> You can safely quit without disconnecting but
RoboJournal
usually requires you to confirm your decision.</div>
<p>Click the <strong>Disconnect</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
the red
circle in Figure 5) to proceed:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 5" src="img/screens/mw_disconnect1.png"
 class="screenshot" height="589" width="753"><span class="caption">Figure
5: The
<strong>Disconnect</strong> toolbar button immediately terminates the
current
connection.</span></p>
<h2 id="new_entry">Writing a New Entry</h2>
<p>You can write a new entry at any time once RoboJournal is in
Connected Mode.
Each entry is represented by a node in the Chronological Entry List.
Unlike
day, month, or year-level nodes, entry-level nodes are marked with an
icon and
have no subordinate nodes. </p>
<p>Whenever you create a new entry, RoboJournal automatically keeps
track of
the date and time for the new record. This allows you to focus entirely
on the
new entry's content. RoboJournal automatically assigns a unique
identification
number (not shown in the user interface) to each entry to prevent
conflicts
between two or more entries with the same title and/or body text. This
identification number is <em>never</em> used more than once in the
same
journal. There is a theoretical limit to how many entries a MySQL-based
journal
may contain but the number is so large (within the billions) that
nobody ever
comes close to reaching it. Therefore, feel free to write as often as
you want.
</p>
<p>The following procedure adds a new entry to the current journal:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Write in Journal</strong> toolbar button on
the RoboJournal main window.<img alt="Figure 6"
 src="img/screens/mw_new_entry.png" class="screenshot" height="589"
 width="753"><span class="caption">Figure 6: Click the <strong>Write
in Journal</strong> button (indicated in red).</span></li>
  <li>The Editor dialog is displayed:<img alt="Figure 6"
 src="img/screens/editor_new_entry.png" class="screenshot" height="518"
 width="656"><span class="caption">Figure 7: RoboJournal Editor dialog
in Write (new entry) Mode.</span></li>
  <li>Enter a title for this entry in the <strong>Entry Title</strong>
field.</li>
  <li>Write the body text for this entry in the large text area.
    <div class="FYI"> <strong>FYI:</strong> The <strong>Character
count</strong> and <strong>Remaining characters</strong> values
indicate how much longer the body text may be (MySQL allows up to
65,535 characters). If the <strong>Remaining characters</strong> value
is negative, RoboJournal prevents you from saving the entry until this
value is greater than or equal to zero. </div>
  </li>
  <li>When finished, click the <strong>Save this Entry</strong> button
(indicated by the circled toolbar icon in the following screenshot):<img
 alt="Figure 8" src="img/screens/editor_new_entry2.png"
 class="screenshot" height="518" width="656"><span class="caption">Figure
8: The <strong>Save this Entry</strong> toolbar button (button labels
have been disabled in RoboJournal Preferences).</span></li>
  <li>RoboJournal displays a confirmation message ("<em>entry_title</em>"
was successfully added to your journal) if the save was successful.</li>
  <li>The new entry is added to the Chronological Entry List. If
desired, you may click on the new entry to display its contents in the
Entry Output Pane:<img alt="Figure 9"
 src="img/screens/mw_new_entry_2.png" class="screenshot" height="589"
 width="753"><span class="caption">Figure 9: The new entry is displayed
in the Chronological Entry List.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modify_entry">Modifying an Existing Entry</h2>
<p>The Editor dialog allows you to modify existing entries after they
have been
saved to the journal database. You may change the title and body text
in any
way you see fit. However, RoboJournal prevents you from changing the
date
because that often creates problems with the rest of the database. Any
special
characters/conditions in the entry text that are affected by <a
 href="preferences.html#post_processing">post-processing</a> (e.g.
ellipsis
characters, dashes, smart quotes, etc.) revert to their original state
during
the editing session in order to make them easier to work with. All
applicable
post-processing features are automatically re-applied after the changes
have
been saved.</p>
<p>The following procedure allows you to change an existing entry:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Select the entry that is to be modified by clicking on its node
in the Chronological Entry List (as shown in the large red oval in
Figure 10). <img alt="Figure 10" src="img/screens/mw_modify1.png"
 class="screenshot" height="584" width="750"><span class="caption">Figure
10: Selecting the entry to be modified.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Modify Entry</strong> toolbar button
(indicated by the small red circle in Figure 10). You can visually
distinguish the <strong>Modify Entry</strong> button from the <strong>Write
in Journal</strong> button by the <strong>Modify Entry</strong>
button's orange pencil color, its central position in the button group,
and its horizontal red lines.</li>
  <li>The Editor window is displayed with the entry data pre-loaded
into the appropriate fields:<img alt="Figure 11"
 src="img/screens/modify1.png" class="screenshot" height="518"
 width="656"><span class="caption">Figure 11: Existing entry text
loaded into Editor (in Edit Mode).</span></li>
  <li>Make all necessary changes. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> toolbar button
(indicated by the red circle in Figure 12) to commit your changes to
the database. The <strong>Save Changes</strong> button replaces the <strong>Save
this Entry</strong> toolbar button while the Editor dialog is in Edit
Mode. If you wish to cancel your edits, you can click the <strong>Discard
Changes</strong> button (located to the immediate right of the <strong>Save
Changes</strong> button) to return to the main window.<img
 alt="Figure 12" src="img/screens/modify2.png" class="screenshot"
 height="518" width="656"><span class="caption">Figure 12: Saving
changes once the edits are complete.</span></li>
  <li>A confirmation message ("<em>entry_title</em>" was successfully
updated.) is displayed if RoboJournal was able to save the entry
successfully. Otherwise, RoboJournal displays a message explaining what
went wrong. In either case, click the <strong>OK</strong> button in
the dialog to continue.</li>
  <li>If the save was successful, the updated entry is displayed in the
Entry Output Pane on the RoboJournal main window. <span class="caption"><img
 alt="Figure 13" src="img/screens/mw_modify2.png" class="screenshot"
 height="584" width="750">Figure 13: The updated entry is shown
immediately after the edit process is completed.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="delete_entry">Deleting an Entry</h2>
<p>RoboJournal's delete function provides a way to easily remove the
currently
selected entry from the database. You should always exercise caution
when using
this feature because delete operations are <em>permanent</em>. The
only way to
undo an accidental deletion is to restore an earlier version of the
journal
that contains the lost data from a backup. </p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Select the entry to be deleted by clicking on its node in the
Chronological Entry List (shown in the large oval area in Figure 14). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Delete Entry</strong> toolbar button
(indicated by the small circle in Figure 14). <img alt="Figure 14"
 src="img/screens/mw_delete1.png" class="screenshot" height="584"
 width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 14: Select the entry you wish
to delete and click the <strong>Delete Entry</strong> button.</span></li>
  <li>A confirmation dialog is displayed as a safety measure. This
dialog is your last opportunity to cancel the delete operation. Click
the <strong>OK</strong> button to approve the delete operation or
click the <strong>Cancel</strong> button to abort. <img
 alt="Figure 15" src="img/screens/mw_delete2.png" class="screenshot"
 height="585" width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 15: A

is your last chance to abort. </span>
    <div class="FYI"> <strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal skips Step 3
if the <a href="preferences.html#global_preferences">Always Show
Confirmation Dialogs</a> option is disabled in RoboJournal Preferences.
In such cases, the delete operation is instantaneous and provides no
chance to abort even if you click the <strong>Delete Entry</strong>
toolbar button accidentally! You should treat the Delete Entry function
with <em>extreme caution</em> if confirmation dialogs have been
disabled. </div>
  </li>
  <li>You are returned to the main window regardless of your decision
in the previous step. If you chose to continue with the delete
operation, the previously-selected entry is now gone: <img
 alt="Figure 16" src="img/screens/mw_delete3.png" class="screenshot"
 height="584" width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 16: The entry
you deleted is no longer displayed in the Chronological Entry List.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="navigate">Navigating the Chronological Entry List</h2>
<p>All entries in the current journal are displayed in ascending
chronological
order; the newest entry is always the first on the list while the
oldest entry
(in the current range) is on the very bottom. RoboJournal has
convenient ways
to browse adjacent entries in the current journal if you wish to read
it in a
chronological fashion. This is accomplished by clicking the <strong>Previous
Entry</strong> and <strong>Next Entry</strong> toolbar buttons on the
RoboJournal main window:<img alt="Figure 17"
 src="img/screens/mw_navigation1.png" class="screenshot" height="585"
 width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 17: The <strong>Previous
Entry</strong> and <strong>Next Entry</strong> buttons allow easy
sequential
browsing.</span></p>
<p>Clicking the <strong>Next Entry</strong> or the <strong>Previous
Entry</strong> toolbar button increments or decrements the current
entry by one
record. The focused (selected) entry in the Chronological Entry List
automatically jumps to the appropriate adjacent record whenever the
entry is
changed this way. If there is no record available before or after the
current
entry because you are viewing the oldest or newest entry, the affected
button
locks to indicate that further browsing in that direction is impossible
(as
shown in Figure 18 where the <strong>Next Entry</strong> button is
locked
because the latest entry is already being displayed). </p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Latest Entry</strong> toolbar button
(indicated by
the red circle in Figure 18) to immediately jump to the most recent
entry in
the database:<img alt="Figure 18" src="img/screens/mw_navigation2.png"
 class="screenshot" height="585" width="750"><span class="caption">Figure
18:
You can use the <strong>Latest Entry</strong> button to display the
newest
entry at any time. RoboJournal can also be configured to display the
latest
entry by default.</span></p>
<h2 id="tag_entry">Tagging an Entry</h2>
