<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases like MySQL are not
discrete files on your hard drive; instead, they are abstract entities you work
with through an intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary program
relays data between the client (your computer) and the actual journal database
residing on the host. While the journal appears to be on your computer, this is
not truly the case unless you are running the database server on localhost.
Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is normally difficult to
extract data from them unless you dump the entire database to disk as a file
(the most common backup method). Fortunately, RoboJournal's Entry Exporter tool
provides a way to directly extract journal content (in part or in whole) from
its database in a form that can be easily backed up or copied.</p>

<p>RoboJournal's entry exporter has been dramatically expanded and re-designed
in version 0.5 (and later). The new design features a page-based interface,
much like the new <a href="getting_started.html#create">Journal Creator</a> and
the new <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window introduced in version
0.4. Unlike the old entry exporter (which separated functionality by use of a
tabbed widget in a way that could potentially be confusing) the new design
separates functionality by page; each page is dedicated to a a specific type of
export operation. The Export Content window always displays the <strong>Export
single entry</strong> page by default. </p>

<p>The entry exporter is invoked the same was as in previous versions. Select
the entry you wish to export (or any entry, if you wish to export the entire
journal) and click the Export Entry toolbar button:<img alt="Figure 1"
src="img/screens/mw_export1.png" class="screenshot" height="584"
width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 1: Select an entry (indicated by the
large oval) and click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button to
display the Export Content dialog.</span></p>

<p>The Export Content window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 1"
src="img/screens/mw_export2.png" class="screenshot" height="591"
width="751"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The Export Content window is
displayed with the selected entry already pre-loaded.</span></p>

<h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>

<p>Once invoked, the Export Content window is already configured to export the
entry you previously selected on the RoboJournal main window: <img
alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/export_single.png" class="screenshot"
height="453" width="576"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The "Export Single
Entry" page allows you to export the current (selected) entry from the main
window.</span></p>

<p>If you need to change any of the settings (including file type or export
destination), you must do so before beginning the export operation. Unlike
other procedures, further user input is completely optional; you only need to
click the <strong>Export</strong> button (as indicated by the red oval in
Figure 3) to complete the process using the current options. The current
options determine the type and properties of the file produced by the next
export operation.</p>

<p>Exporting a single entry is designed to be extremely simple since most
configuration requirements are preset in advance. Generally, you only need to
click the <strong>Export</strong> button (shown in Figure 3) after selecting
the entry you wish to export from the Timeline on the
RoboJournal main window.</p>

<h3 id="L131">Single Export Options</h3>

<p>The following table explains each option on the Export Single Entry page in
greater detail:</p>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field determines what
        name the entry content is saved under on your hard drive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Location</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Export Location</strong> field lists the
        path to the folder where the output file will be saved. Click the
        <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this field to select a
        different folder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The Export Format options determine which type of file
        is created during the export operation. The <strong>HTML</strong>
        option produces a HTML4-compliant document that is viewable in any web
        browser. The <strong>Plain text</strong> option produces a text file
        that is compatible with any text editor (e.g. Vim, Notepad, Emacs,
        etc.). 

        <p>For best results, you should use HTML output because it preserves
        all document formatting (bold, italic, etc. text) while plain text
        output does not. As such, the option you should choose depends on your
        requirements. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include entry date in filename</td>
      <td class="right">This option appends the current date, in <em>day of
        week_mm-dd-yyyy</em> format, to the filename. For best results, you
        should leave this option enabled each time you export an entry.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include journal in filename</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option inserts the journal name at the
        beginning of the Filename field (i.e. <em>journal name</em>_entry
        title_entry date). You should leave this option enabled for best
        results because the resulting filename makes it easy to group exported
        entries from the same journal together and it provides a way for you to
        easily recognize which journal an entry came from.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename</td>
      <td class="right">When checked, this option allows you to directly edit
        the <strong>Filename</strong> field's contents. You should enable this
        feature if it is necessary to assign a custom filename to an output
        file.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>

<p>In addition to exporting entries one at a time, RoboJournal also allows you
to export an entire journal at once. This task can be done in two different
ways. RoboJournal can merge each entry into a single large file (the "original"
method featured since version 0.3). In version 0.5, RoboJournal introduces a
new bulk export method where a journal can be exported as a set of discrete
files. This new feature produces the same results as manually exporting the
journal one entry at a time but is much faster and more efficient. Each entry
is saved individually and is placed with the others in a predetermined
destination folder bearing the name of the journal and the export date. </p>

<p>The bulk export feature is accessed by the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from the Chronological
    Entry List and click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (as
    shown in Figure 1) to display the Export Content window. It does not matter
    which entry you choose if you intend to export the entire journal.</li>
  <li>The Export Content window is displayed. Select the <strong>Export Entire
    Journal</strong> list item on the left side of the Export Content window to
    display the appropriate options:<img alt="Figure 4"
    src="img/screens/export_multi.png" class="screenshot" height="453"
    width="576"><span class="caption">Figure 4: The "Export Entire Journal"
    page allows you to output the contents of an entire journal in one simple
    process.</span></li>
  <li>Adjust the options in the Export Location, Export Format, and Export
    Options groups if necessary. Each of these settings and their effects are
    addressed in-depth in the following section. The default configuration
    produces a single HTML-based file (with the journal name and the export
    date in the filename) with all journal entries arranged in descending
  order.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to complete the operation.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="L253">Bulk Export Options</h3>

<p>The following table contains a full explanation of all options that can be
applied to bulk export operations and the effects each option has on the output
file(s):</p>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field determines what
        name the entry content is saved under on your hard drive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export location</td>
      <td class="right">This field determines where the output file is stored.
        If the <strong>Keep individual entries separate</strong> option is
        enabled, the output files are stored in a custom folder (bearing the
        journal name and the export date) within the directory specified in the
        <strong>Export location</strong> field. Click the
        <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this field to select a
        different folder. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The Export Format options determine which type of
        file(s() are created during the export operation. The
        <strong>HTML</strong> option produces HTML4-compliant document(s) that
        are viewable in any web browser. The <strong>Plain text</strong> option
        produces text file(s) that are compatible with any text editor (e.g.
        Vim, Notepad, Emacs, etc.). 

        <p>For best results, you should use HTML output because it preserves

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include export date<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">If enabled, this option causes the current export date
        to be included in the filename (i.e. sample_journal_<span
        style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">09-03-2013</span>.html). This feature is
        useful for archival purposes since it indicates what a journal
        contained on a specific date. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Keep individual entries separate</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option causes RoboJournal to export
        the current journal as a set of discrete files, with one entry per
        file. Enabling this option disables many other settings on the
        <strong>Export entire journal</strong> page that are only relevant to
        the task of creating a single large export file. 

        <p>The output files from the export operation are saved in a custom
        folder contained within the current <strong>Export location</strong>
        directory. RoboJournal automatically creates the export folder during
        the procedure so there is no need to manually create it in advance.
        Each file in the folder is marked with the journal name, its position
        in the series, and the entry title (i.e.
        sample_journal_1_of_15_sample_entry.html). </p>

        <p>Exporting the journal as a series of individual entries always sorts
        the content in ascending chronological order, with the oldest entry
        being the first item in the set. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">When selected, this option allows you to directly edit
        the <strong>Filename</strong> field's contents. You should enable this
        feature if the situation requires you to assign a custom filename to
        the output file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sort in ascending/descending order<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">These two options determine the chronological order in
        which entries are merged into the output file. Arranging entries in
        ascending order causes the oldest entry to be listed first while
        descending order places the latest entry first in the sequence.
        RoboJournal chooses the descending arrangement by default because it
        assumes the most recent entries are the most important to the reader
        (and should therefore be listed first). </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p class="footnote">* RoboJournal locks these options (and ignores their
current settings) while the <strong>Keep individual entries separate</strong>
option is enabled because the affected options are non-applicable to multiple
files.</p>

<h2 id="L370">Creating a Backup of Your Journal with MySQLDump</h2>

<p>RoboJournal 0.5 introduces a new feature that allows you to easily create a
backup of the current active journal. Backing up a journal is useful because it
allows you to "freeze" the current condition of your journal at a specific
moment in time. You can then use this backup at a later time to restore or
revert your journal to the state it was in when the backup was created. For
best results, you should create backups on a regular basis and store them in a
safe place in case the working copy of the database becomes corrupt or is lost
due to equipment failure.</p>

<p>RoboJournal uses a utility called MySQLDump to create the backups (MySQLDump
is usually distributed along with MySQL). In the past, this task required you
to invoke MySQLDump manually via the command line but RoboJournal is now
capable of directly interfacing with MySQLDump through an easy-to-use graphical
user interface. At the moment, RoboJournal offers no direct way to restore
databases from backups but that feature is planned for future versions.</p>

<p>You can export your journals by completing the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from the Chronological
    Entry List and click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (as
    shown in Figure 1) to display the Export Content window. For this
    procedure, it does not matter which entry you choose from the list. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Backup MySQL Journal</strong> list item on the left
    side of the Export Content window to display the backup-related options
    (Figure 5): <img style="width: 576px; height: 453px;" class="screenshot"
    alt="Figure x" title="Figure x" src="img/screens/export_dump.png"><span
    class="caption">Figure 5: The "Backup MySQL Journal" page provides an
    easy-to-use interface for MySQLDump.</span></li>
  <li>Make all necessary changes. The default settings produce a .sql file
    bearing the journal name and the export date (i.e.
    sample_journal_09-04-2013)  that is saved in your home folder's Documents
    sub-directory ("My Documents" on Windows XP and older). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to begin the operation: <img
    alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/export_dump2.png" width="576" height="453"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: Click the
    <strong>Export</strong> button when ready.</span></li>
  <li>Enter the root password for MySQL when prompted and click the
    <strong>OK</strong> button to continue:<img alt="Figure 7"
    src="img/screens/export_dump3.png" width="266" height="128"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7: Enter the current MySQL
    server's root password to continue.</span> RoboJournal requires root-level
    access for MySQLDump operations because it must lock the current journal's
    tables (a function that is normally restricted to the root account) before
    it can complete the dump operation. This prevents the possibility of edit
    collisions, which are attempts by two or more users to modify the same
    database simultaneously. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Export Content window closes itself once the operation is
    complete.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="L419">Backup Options<br>
</h3>

<p>The following table contains a full explanation of all options that can be
applied to backup operations and the effects each option has on the output
file:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Output filename<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">The Output filename field determines what name the
        entry content is saved under on your hard drive. This file always has a
        <em>.sql</em> extension.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">If checked, RoboJournal allows you to directly edit the
        contents of the <strong>Output filename</strong> field (which are
        otherwise read-only). When you click the <strong>Export</strong>
        button, RoboJournal automatically appends the correct extension if the
        current filename does not end with <i>.sql</i>.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Output file location<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">This field determines where the output file is saved
        (the Documents folder in your home directory is the default location).
        Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this field to
        select a different folder.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Path to MySQLDump utility<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">This field lists the absolute path to the MySQLDump
        executable on your computer. Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button
        to the right of this field to manually locate MySQLDump. While running
        on Windows, RoboJournal restricts the file browser to mysqldump.exe but
        there are no such restrictions on Linux/Unix because executables have
        no extensions on those operating systems. Once you have located the
        MySQLDump executable with the file browser, RoboJournal saves the
        selected pathname so you will not need to browse for it again.<br>
