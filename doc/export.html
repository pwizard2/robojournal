<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases like MySQL are not
discrete files on your hard drive; instead, they are abstract entities you work
with through an intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary program
relays data between the client (your computer) and the actual journal database
residing on the host. While the journal appears to be on your computer, this is
not truly the case unless you are running the database server on localhost.
Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is normally difficult to
extract data from them unless you dump the entire database to disk as a file
(the most common backup method). Fortunately, RoboJournal's Entry Exporter tool
provides a way to directly extract journal content (in part or in whole) from
its database in a form that can be easily backed up or copied.</p>

<p>RoboJournal's entry exporter has been dramatically expanded and re-designed
in version 0.5 (and later). The new design features a page-based interface,
much like the new <a href="getting_started.html#create">Journal Creator</a> and
the new <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window introduced in version
0.4. Unlike the old entry exporter (which separated functionality by use of a
tabbed widget in a way that could potentially be confusing) the new design
separates functionality by page; each page is dedicated to a a specific type of
export operation. The Export Content window always displays the <strong>Export
single entry</strong> page by default. </p>

<p>The entry exporter is invoked the same was as in previous versions. Select
the entry you wish to export (or any entry, if you wish to export the entire
journal) and click the Export Entry toolbar button:<img alt="Figure 1"

class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 1: Select an entry (indicated
by the large oval) and click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button
to display the Export Content dialog.</span></p>

<p>The Export Content window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 1"
src="img/screens/mw_export2.png" width="751" height="591"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The Export Content window is
displayed with the selected entry already pre-loaded.</span></p>

<h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>

<p>Unless you have selected a different page, the Export Content window should
already be configured to export the entry you previously selected immediately
before clicking the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button on the
RoboJournal main window. <img alt="Figure 3"
src="img/screens/export_single.png" width="576" height="453"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The <strong>Export single
entry</strong> page allows you to export the current (selected) entry from the
main window.</span></p>

<p>If you need to change any of the settings (including file type or export
destination), you must do so before beginning the export operation. Unlike
other procedures, further user input is completely optional; you only need to
click the <strong>Export</strong> button (as indicated by the red oval in
Figure 3) to complete the process using the current options. The current
options determine the type and properties of the file produced by the next
export operation.</p>

<p>The following table explains each option on the <strong>Export single
entry</strong> page in greater detail:</p>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field determines what
        name the entry content is saved under on your hard drive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Location</td>
      <td class="right"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include entry date in filename</td>
      <td class="right"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include journal in filename</td>
      <td class="right"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename</td>
      <td class="right"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>

<p>As previously stated, RoboJournal allows you to export an entire journal at
once. This is much faster and produces better results than the only other
alternative method (manually exporting the journal one entry at a time) because
it loops through the entire journal and appends each entry to a single file.
