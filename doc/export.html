      <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases
      like MySQL are not discrete files on your hard drive;
      instead, they are abstract entities you work with through an
      intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary
      program relays data between the client (your computer) and
      the actual journal database residing on the host. While the
      journal appears to be on your computer, this is not truly the
      case unless you are running the database server on localhost.
      Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is
      normally difficult to extract data from them unless you dump
      the entire database to disk as a file (the most common backup
      method). Fortunately, RoboJournal provides a way to directly
      extract journal content in a form that can be easily backed
      up or copied.</p>

      <p>To begin, select the entry you wish to export (or any
      entry, if you wish to export the entire journal) and click
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Export Entry</span>
      toolbar button.<img alt="Figure 1" src=
      "img/screens/mw_export1.png" class="screenshot" height="584"
      width="750"><span class="caption">Figure 1: Select an entry
      (indicated by the large oval) and click the <strong>Export
      Content</strong> toolbar button to display the Export Content
      dialog.</span></p>

      <p>This action displays the Export Content window:</p>

      <p><img alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_export2.png"
      class="screenshot" height="591" width="751"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 2: The Export Content window is displayed
      with the selected entry already pre-loaded.</span></p>

      <p>RoboJournal's export functionality has been dramatically
      improved in version 0.5. The new design features a page-based
      interface, much like the new <a href=
      "getting_started.html#create">Journal Creator</a> and the new
      <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window introduced
      in version 0.4. The Export Content window offers a menu with
      three items on the left side of its interface with its
      remaining space devoted to options related to the
      currently-selected item. Unlike the old entry exporter (which
      separated functionality by use of a tabbed widget in a way
      that could potentially be confusing) the new design separates
      functionality by page; each page is dedicated to a a specific
      type of export function.<br></p>

      <p>The Export Content window always displays the
      <strong>Export single entry</strong> page by default. You can
      switch to a different page at any time by clicking a
      different item on the list. When you click the <span style=
      "font-weight: bold;">Export</span> button, RoboJournal
      applies actions that are relevant to the current page only
      (all settings on inactive pages are ignored).&nbsp; The
      following sections describe the various pages (and their
      functions) in greater detail.<br></p>

      <h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>

      <p>When initially opened, the Export Content window is
      automatically configured to export the entry you previously
      selected from the Timeline on the RoboJournal main window:
      <img alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/export_single.png"
      class="screenshot" height="453" width="576"><span class=
      "caption">Figure 3: The "Export Single Entry" page allows you
      to export the current (selected) entry from the main
      window.</span></p>

      <p>If you need to change any of the settings (including file
      type or export destination), you must do so before beginning
      the export operation. Exporting a single entry is designed to
      be extremely simple since most configuration requirements are
      pre-set in advance. The available options control the output
      file properties.<br></p>

      <p>Generally, you only need to click the
      <strong>Export</strong> button (shown in Figure 3) after
      selecting the entry you wish to export from the Timeline on
      the RoboJournal main window. The Export Content window
      provides output and automatically closes once its task is
      finished.</p>

      <h3 id="L131">Single Export Options</h3>

      <p>The following table explains each option on the Export
      Single Entry page in greater detail:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <col>
        <col>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="left">Filename</td>

            <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field
            determines what name the entry content is saved under
            on your hard drive. This field is read-only by default
            and cannot be edited directly unless the <span style=
            "font-weight: bold;">Allow custom filename</span>
            option is enabled.<br></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Export Location</td>

            <td class="right">The <strong>Export Location</strong>
            field lists the path to the folder where the output
            file will be saved. Click the <strong>Browse</strong>
            button to the right of this field to select a different
            folder.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Export Format</td>

            <td class="right">
              The Export Format options determine which type of
              file is created during the export operation. The
              <strong>HTML</strong> option produces a
              HTML4-compliant document that is viewable in any web
              browser. The <strong>Plain text</strong> option
              produces a text file that is compatible with any text
              editor (e.g. Vim, Notepad, Emacs, etc.).

              <p>For best results, you should use HTML output
              because it preserves all document formatting (bold,
              italic, etc. text) while plain text output does not.
              As such, the option you should choose depends on your
              requirements.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Include entry date in filename</td>

            <td class="right">This option appends the current date,
            in <em>day of week_mm-dd-yyyy</em> format, to the
            filename. For best results, you should leave this
            option enabled each time you export an entry.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Include journal in filename</td>

            <td class="right">If checked, this option inserts the
            journal name at the beginning of the Filename field
            (i.e. <em>journal name</em>_entry title_entry date).
            You should leave this option enabled for best results
            because the resulting filename makes it easy to group
            exported entries from the same journal together and it
            provides a way for you to easily recognize which
            journal an entry came from.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Allow custom filename</td>

            <td class="right">When checked, this option allows you
            to directly edit the <strong>Filename</strong> field's
            contents. You should enable this feature if it is
            necessary to assign a custom filename to an output
            file.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>

      <p>In addition to exporting entries one at a time,
      RoboJournal also allows you to export an entire journal at
      once. This task can be done in two different ways.
      RoboJournal can merge each entry into a single large file
      (the "original" method featured since version 0.3). In
      version 0.5, RoboJournal introduces a new bulk export method
      where a journal can be exported as a set of discrete files.
      This new feature produces the same results as manually
      exporting the entire journal one entry at a time but is much
      more efficient and convenient. Under this new method, each
      entry is saved individually and is placed with the others in
      a predetermined destination folder bearing the name of the
      journal and the export date.</p>

      <p>You can access the bulk-export function through the
      following procedure:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from
        the Timeline and click the <strong>Export Content</strong>
        toolbar button (as shown in Figure 1) to display the Export
        Content window. It does not matter which entry you choose
        to begin this process.</li>

        <li>The Export Content window is displayed. Select the
        <strong>Export Entire Journal</strong> list item on the
        left side of the Export Content window to display the
        appropriate options:<img alt="Figure 4" src=
        "img/screens/export_multi.png" class="screenshot" height=
        "453" width="576"><span class="caption">Figure 4: The
        "Export Entire Journal" page allows you to output the
        contents of an entire journal in one simple
        process.</span></li>

        <li>Adjust the options in the Export Location, Export
        Format, and Export Options groups if necessary. Each of
        these settings and their effects are addressed in-depth in
        the Bulk Export Options section. The default configuration
        produces a single HTML-based file (with the journal name
        and the export date in the filename) with all journal
        entries arranged in descending order.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to continue.
        The Export Content window provides output and automatically
        closes once its task is finished.<br></li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="L253">Bulk Export Options</h3>

      <p>The following table contains a full explanation of all
      options that can be applied to bulk export operations and the
      effects each option has on the output file(s):</p>

      <table border="0">

            <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field
            determines what name the entry content is saved under
            on your hard drive.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Export location</td>

            <td class="right">This field determines where the
            output file is stored. If the <strong>Keep individual
            entries separate</strong> option is enabled, the output
            files are stored in a custom folder (bearing the
            journal name and the export date) within the directory
            specified in the <strong>Export location</strong>
            field. Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to the
            right of this field to select a different folder.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Export Format</td>

            <td class="right">
              The Export Format options determine which type of
              file(s) are created during the export operation. The
              <strong>HTML</strong> option produces HTML4-compliant
              documents that are viewable in any web browser. The
              <strong>Plain text</strong> option produces text
              files that are compatible with any text editor (e.g.

            <td class="right">If enabled, this option causes the

            (i.e. sample_journal_<span style=
            "color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">09-03-2013</span>.html). This
            feature is useful for archival purposes since it
            indicates what a journal contained on a specific
            date.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Keep individual entries separate</td>

            <td class="right">
              If checked, this option causes RoboJournal to export
              the current journal as a set of discrete files, with
              one entry per file. Enabling this option disables
              many other settings on the <strong>Export entire
              journal</strong> page that are only relevant to the
              task of creating a single large export file.

              <p>The output files from the export operation are
              saved in a custom folder contained within the current
              <strong>Export location</strong> directory.
              RoboJournal automatically creates the export folder
              during the procedure so there is no need to manually
              create it in advance. Each file in the folder is
              marked with the journal name, its position in the
              series, and the entry title (i.e.
              sample_journal_1_of_15_sample_entry.html).</p>

              <p>Exporting the journal as a series of individual

            <td class="right">These two options determine the

            causes the oldest entry to be listed first while
            descending order places the latest entry first in the
            sequence. RoboJournal chooses the descending
            arrangement by default because it assumes the most
            recent entries are the most important to the reader
            (and should therefore be listed first).</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p class="footnote">* RoboJournal locks these options (and
      ignores their current settings) while the <strong>Keep
      individual entries separate</strong> option is enabled
      because the affected options are non-applicable to multiple
      files.</p>

      <h2 id="L370">Creating a Backup of Your Journal with
      MySQLDump</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal 0.5 introduces a new feature that allows you
      to easily create a backup of the current active journal.
      Backing up a journal is useful because it allows you to
      "freeze" the current condition of your journal at a specific
      moment in time. You can then use this backup at a later time
      to restore or revert your journal to the state it was in when
      the backup was created. For best results, you should create
      backups on a regular basis and store them in a safe place in
      case the working copy of the database becomes corrupt or is
      lost due to equipment failure.</p>

      <p>RoboJournal uses a utility called MySQLDump to create the
      backups (MySQLDump is usually distributed along with MySQL).
      In the past, this task required you to invoke MySQLDump
      manually via the command line but RoboJournal is now capable
      of directly interfacing with MySQLDump through an easy-to-use
      graphical user interface. At the moment, RoboJournal offers
      no direct way to restore databases from backups but that
      feature is planned for future versions.</p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <b>FYI:</b> If the current journal is located on a remote
        host (<i>i.e.</i> not "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"),
        RoboJournal locks the export options because there is no
        way to dump a remote database with the locally-installed
        copy of MySQLDump. If you need to back up such a journal,
        you must access the remote computer either physically or
        through remote access protocols (SSH or RDP) and run
        MySQLDump that way.
      </div>

      <p>You can export your journals by completing the following
      procedure:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from
        the Chronological Entry List and click the <strong>Export
        Content</strong> toolbar button (as shown in Figure 1) to
        display the Export Content window. For this procedure, it
        does not matter which entry you choose from the list.</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Backup MySQL/MariaDB Journal</strong>
        list item on the left side of the Export Content window to
        display the backup-related options (Figure 5): <img style=
        "width: 576px; height: 453px;" class="screenshot" alt=
        "Figure x" title="Figure x" src=
        "img/screens/export_dump.png"><span class="caption">Figure
        5: The "Backup MySQL/MariaDB Journal" page provides an
        easy-to-use interface for MySQLDump.</span></li>

        <li>Make all necessary changes. The default settings
        produce a .sql file bearing the journal name and the export
        date (i.e. sample_journal_09-04-2013.sql)&nbsp; that is
        saved in your home folder/profile's "Documents"
        sub-directory ("My Documents" on Windows XP and
        older).</li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to begin the
        operation: <img alt="Figure 6" src=

        root-level access for MySQLDump operations because it must
        lock the current journal's tables (a function that is
        normally restricted to the root account) before it can
        complete the dump operation.&nbsp;This prevents the
        possibility of edit collisions, which are attempts by two
        or more users to modify the same database
        simultaneously.<br></li>

      <h3 id="L419">Backup Options<br></h3>

      <p>The following table contains a full explanation of all
      options that can be applied to backup operations and the
      effects each option has on the output file:</p>

      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="left">Output filename<br></td>

            <td class="right">The <strong>Output filename</strong>
            field determines the name the entry content is saved
            under on your hard drive. This file always has a
            <em>.sql</em> extension.<br></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Allow custom filename<br></td>

            <td class="right">If checked, RoboJournal allows you to
            choose your own filename by directly editing the
            contents of the <strong>Output filename</strong> field
            (which are otherwise read-only). Despite the freedom
            this feature offers, RoboJournal strictly enforces
            certain guidelines:<br>
            <br>
            When you click the <strong>Export</strong> button,
            RoboJournal corrects any errors it detects in the
            filename, including replacing spaces with underscore
            ("_") characters and removing forbidden characters like
            [semi]colons, slashes, etc. As you edit the text in the
            field, RoboJournal constantly ensures the filename you
            have chosen ends with an appropriate <i>.sql</i>
            extension at all times.<br>
            <br>
            When the Allow <strong>custom filename field</strong>
            is unchecked, RoboJournal utilizes a <i>[journal
            name]_[export date].sql</i> naming convention (i.e.
            sample_journal_09-23-2013) for all output
            files.<br></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Output file location<br></td>

            <td class="right">This field determines where the
            output file is saved (the Documents folder in your home
            directory is the default location). Click the
            <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this
            field to select a different folder.<br></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Path to MySQLDump utility<br></td>

            <td class="right">This field lists the absolute path to
            the MySQLDump executable on your computer. Click the
            <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this
            field to manually locate MySQLDump.<br>
            <br>
            While running on Windows, RoboJournal restricts the
            file browser to mysqldump.exe but there are no such
            restrictions on Linux/Unix because executables have no
            extension on those operating systems. Once you have
            located the MySQLDump executable with the file browser,
            RoboJournal saves the selected pathname so you will not
            need to browse for it again.<br></td>

</ol>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases like MySQL are not
discrete files on your hard drive; instead, they are abstract entities you work
with through an intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary program
relays data between the client (your computer) and the actual journal database
residing on the host. While the journal appears to be on your computer, this is
not truly the case unless you are running the database server on localhost. </p>

<p>Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is normally difficult
to extract data from them unless you dump the entire database to disk as a file
(the most common backup method). Fortunately, RoboJournal provides a way to
directly extract journal content (in part or in whole) from its database in a
form that can be easily backed up or copied.</p>

<h3 id="Formats">Export Formats</h3>

<p>RoboJournal currently supports two export formats for your entry data. Both
formats are universally-compatible with every operating system and many
handheld devices as well. </p>

<h4>HTML Export</h4>

<p>HTML formatting causes the exported section(s) to be saved as HTML files
that can be displayed in any web browser. Since RoboJournal already stores
entries in HTML format, this option preserves all existing formatting.
Therefore, it is the recommended format for both individual entries and full
journal exports. The appearance and function of HTML output documents are
controlled through <a href="preferences.html#export_settings">current
settings</a> found in the RoboJournal Preferences. </p>

<h4>Plain Text Export</h4>

<p>Plain text export causes the exported section(s) to be formatted as plain
text files meant to be read with a text editor like Vim or Notepad. RoboJournal
automatically formats the text file for the operating system it is currently
running on (such as using the proper linebreak character).</p>

<h3 id="Anatomy">Export Options and Settings</h3>

<p>The Export Content window interface consists of two tabs that are very
similar to each other yet work very differently. The <strong>Export Single
Entry</strong> tab contains options applicable to individual entries while the
options on the <strong>Export Entire Journal</strong> tab affect the entire
journal. The following tables list and describe the options found on the Export
Content window based on the tab on which they are found. </p>

<p>The <strong>Export Location</strong> field displays the folder where all
exported entries are to be placed. This field is always visible no matter which
tab is selected. </p>

<h4><strong><em>Export Single Entry</em></strong> Tab</h4>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field contains the name
        to be applied to the entry you have selected for export. The length and
        complexity of the filename are determined by the options you currently
        have selected. The base filename is determined by the title of the
        entry to be exported. RoboJournal automatically strips out all
        characters (like colons or forward/backward slashes) that would produce
        an illegal filename on Windows or Unix if such characters are found in
        the entry title. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The options in this group determine what type of file
        is produced by the export process. Clicking the <strong>HTML
        (recommended)</strong> button causes RoboJournal to export the entry as
        a web document while the <strong>Plain Text</strong> option produces a
        plain text file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Date</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option appends the entry date (plus
        the day of the week on which it was written) to the filename (i.e.
        sample_journal_new_entry_<span
        style="color:#ff0000">friday_1-4-2013</span>.html). </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Journal Name</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option includes the journal name in
        the filename (i.e. <span
        style="color:#ff0000">sample_journal_</span>new_entry_friday_1-4-2013.html).
        This option is recommended because it makes it easier to remember which
        journal an entry came from. </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4><em>Export Entire Journal</em> Tab</h4>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field contains the name
        to be applied to the entry you have selected for export. The length and
        complexity of the filename are determined by the options you currently
        have selected. RoboJournal uses the name of the journal as the base
        filename. RoboJournal automatically strips out all characters (like
        colons or forward/backward slashes) that would produce an illegal
        filename on Windows or Unix if such characters are found in the entry
        title. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The options in this group determine what type of file
        is produced by the export process. Clicking the <strong>HTML
        (recommended)</strong> button causes RoboJournal to export the journal
        as a web document while the <strong>Plain Text</strong> option produces
        a plain text file. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Export Date</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option causes RoboJournal to append
        the current date to the filename (i.e. sample_journal<span
        style="color:#ff0000">_01-20-2013</span>.html). This option is ideal
        for archival purposes because it allows you to see the journal as it
        was at a specific point in time. This option also allows you to export
        the journal multiple times without having to replace older
      versions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sort Ascending/Sort Descending</td>
      <td class="right">This option controls the order in which entries are
        placed in the exported document. Selecting the <strong>Sort
        Ascending</strong> option causes the newest entry to be placed first
        while <strong>Sort Descending</strong> does the opposite.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>

<p>Like the <a href="tags.html">Manage Tags</a> window, RoboJournal's export
system is designed to target a specific entry (even when you use it to export
an entire journal at once). The following procedure instructs you how to target
a specific entry and bring up the Export Content window:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select the desired entry in the Chronological Entry List (the
    selected entry is shown within the large oval in Figure 1).<img
    alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_export1.png" width="750" height="584"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 1: Select an entry and
    click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button to display the
    Export Content dialog.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
    the small circle in Figure 1).</li>
  <li>The Export Content window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 2"
    src="img/screens/mw_export2.png" width="752" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The Export Content
    window is always superimposed over the main window.</span></li>
  <li>Ensure that all <strong>Export Format</strong> and <strong>Filename
    Options</strong> settings (indicated by the red oval in Figure 3) are
    configured appropriately and change them if necessary.<img alt="Figure 3"
    src="img/screens/mw_export3.png" width="752" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The options indicated by
    the red circle have a direct impact on the predetermined Filename.
  </span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue (a confirmation message
    is displayed if the export operation is successful).<span
    class="caption"></span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>

<p>As previously stated, RoboJournal allows you to export an entire journal at
once. This is much faster and produces better results than the only other
alternative method (manually exporting the journal one entry at a time) because
it loops through the entire journal and appends each entry to a single file.
</p>

<p>The procedure for exporting the entire journal is very much the same as
exporting a single entry:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select an entry (indicated by the oval in Figure 4) from the
    Chronological Entry List. Unlike in the previous procedure, it does not
    matter which entry you choose since you intend to export the entire
    journal.<img alt="Figure 4" src="img/screens/mw_export1.png" width="750"
    height="584" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: You can
    select any entry if you intend to export the entire journal.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
    the small circle in Figure 4). The Export Content window is displayed.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Entire Journal</strong> tab (indicated by the
    oval in Figure 5) to switch to it.<img alt="Figure 5"
    src="img/screens/mw_export5.png" width="751" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: The procedure for
    exporting the entire journal is very similar to that of exporting a single
    entry until you get to this point.</span></li>
  <li>Check the circled options in Figure 6 to ensure they are set properly.
    Change them if necessary.<img alt="Figure 7"
    src="img/screens/mw_export6.png" width="751" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7: At first glance, these
    options look similar to those in Figure 3 but these affect the entire
    journal rather than a single entry.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue. A confirmation message
    is displayed if the export operation is successful. </li>
