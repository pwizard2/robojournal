<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases like MySQL are not
discrete files on your hard drive; instead, they are abstract entities you work
with through an intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary program
relays data between the client (your computer) and the actual journal database
residing on the host. While the journal appears to be on your computer, this is
not truly the case unless you are running the database server on localhost. </p>

<p>Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is normally difficult
to extract data from them unless you dump the entire database to disk as a file
(the most common backup method). Fortunately, RoboJournal provides a way to
directly extract journal content (in part or in whole) from its database in a
form that can be easily backed up or copied.</p>

<h3 id="Formats">Export Formats</h3>

<p>RoboJournal currently supports two export formats for your entry data. Both
formats are universally-compatible with every operating system and many
handheld devices as well. </p>

<h4>HTML Export</h4>

<p>HTML formatting causes the exported section(s) to be saved as HTML files
that can be displayed in any web browser. Since RoboJournal already stores
entries in HTML format, this option preserves all existing formatting.
Therefore, it is the recommended format for both individual entries and full
journal exports. The appearance and function of HTML output documents are
controlled through <a href="preferences.html#export_settings">current
settings</a> found in the RoboJournal Preferences. </p>

<h4>Plain Text Export</h4>

<p>Plain text export causes the exported section(s) to be formatted as plain
text files meant to be read with a text editor like Vim or Notepad. RoboJournal
automatically formats the text file for the operating system it is currently
running on (such as using the proper linebreak character).</p>

<h3 id="Anatomy">Export Options and Settings</h3>

<p>The Export Content window interface consists of two tabs that are very
similar to each other yet work very differently. The <strong>Export Single
Entry</strong> tab contains options applicable to individual entries while the
options on the <strong>Export Entire Journal</strong> tab affect the entire
journal. The following tables list and describe the options found on the Export
Content window based on the tab on which they are found. </p>

<p>The <strong>Export Location</strong> field displays the folder where all
exported entries are to be placed. This field is always visible no matter which
tab is selected. </p>

<h4><strong><em>Export Single Entry</em></strong> Tab</h4>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field contains the name
        to be applied to the entry you have selected for export. The length and
        complexity of the filename are determined by the options you currently
        have selected. The base filename is determined by the title of the
        entry to be exported. RoboJournal automatically strips out all
        characters (like colons or forward/backward slashes) that would produce
        an illegal filename on Windows or Unix if such characters are found in
        the entry title. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The options in this group determine what type of file
        is produced by the export process. Clicking the <strong>HTML
        (recommended)</strong> button causes RoboJournal to export the entry as
        a web document while the <strong>Plain Text</strong> option produces a
        plain text file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Date</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option appends the entry date (plus
        the day of the week on which it was written) to the filename (i.e.
        sample_journal_new_entry_<span
        style="color:#ff0000">friday_1-4-2013</span>.html). </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Journal Name</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option includes the journal name in
        the filename (i.e. <span
        style="color:#ff0000">sample_journal_</span>new_entry_friday_1-4-2013.html).
        This option is recommended because it makes it easier to remember which
        journal an entry came from. </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4><em>Export Entire Journal</em> Tab</h4>

<table border="0">
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field contains the name
        to be applied to the entry you have selected for export. The length and
        complexity of the filename are determined by the options you currently
        have selected. RoboJournal uses the name of the journal as the base
        filename. RoboJournal automatically strips out all characters (like
        colons or forward/backward slashes) that would produce an illegal
        filename on Windows or Unix if such characters are found in the entry
        title. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The options in this group determine what type of file
        is produced by the export process. Clicking the <strong>HTML
        (recommended)</strong> button causes RoboJournal to export the journal
        as a web document while the <strong>Plain Text</strong> option produces
        a plain text file. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include Export Date</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option causes RoboJournal to append
        the current date to the filename (i.e. sample_journal<span
        style="color:#ff0000">_01-20-2013</span>.html). This option is ideal
        for archival purposes because it allows you to see the journal as it
        was at a specific point in time. This option also allows you to export
        the journal multiple times without having to replace older
      versions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sort Ascending/Sort Descending</td>
      <td class="right">This option controls the order in which entries are
        placed in the exported document. Selecting the <strong>Sort
        Ascending</strong> option causes the newest entry to be placed first
        while <strong>Sort Descending</strong> does the opposite.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>

<p>Like the <a href="tags.html">Manage Tags</a> window, RoboJournal's export
system is designed to target a specific entry (even when you use it to export
an entire journal at once). The following procedure instructs you how to target
a specific entry and bring up the Export Content window:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select the desired entry in the Chronological Entry List (the
    selected entry is shown within the large oval in Figure 1).<img
    alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_export1.png" width="750" height="584"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 1: Select an entry and
    click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button to display the
    Export Content dialog.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
    the small circle in Figure 1).</li>
  <li>The Export Content window is displayed:<img alt="Figure 2"
    src="img/screens/mw_export2.png" width="752" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 2: The Export Content
    window is always superimposed over the main window.</span></li>
  <li>Ensure that all <strong>Export Format</strong> and <strong>Filename
    Options</strong> settings (indicated by the red oval in Figure 3) are
    configured appropriately and change them if necessary.<img alt="Figure 3"
    src="img/screens/mw_export3.png" width="752" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The options indicated by
    the red circle have a direct impact on the predetermined Filename.
  </span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue (a confirmation message
    is displayed if the export operation is successful).<span
    class="caption"></span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>

<p>As previously stated, RoboJournal allows you to export an entire journal at
once. This is much faster and produces better results than the only other
alternative method (manually exporting the journal one entry at a time) because
it loops through the entire journal and appends each entry to a single file.
</p>

<p>The procedure for exporting the entire journal is very much the same as
exporting a single entry:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click to select an entry (indicated by the oval in Figure 4) from the
    Chronological Entry List. Unlike in the previous procedure, it does not
    matter which entry you choose since you intend to export the entire
    journal.<img alt="Figure 4" src="img/screens/mw_export1.png" width="750"
    height="584" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: You can
    select any entry if you intend to export the entire journal.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar button (indicated by
    the small circle in Figure 4). The Export Content window is displayed.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export Entire Journal</strong> tab (indicated by the
    oval in Figure 5) to switch to it.<img alt="Figure 5"
    src="img/screens/mw_export5.png" width="751" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: The procedure for
    exporting the entire journal is very similar to that of exporting a single
    entry until you get to this point.</span></li>
  <li>Check the circled options in Figure 6 to ensure they are set properly.
    Change them if necessary.<img alt="Figure 7"
    src="img/screens/mw_export6.png" width="751" height="585"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 7: At first glance, these
    options look similar to those in Figure 3 but these affect the entire
    journal rather than a single entry.</span></li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to continue. A confirmation message
    is displayed if the export operation is successful. </li>
