<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>RoboJournal stores all journals as databases. Databases like MySQL
are not
discrete files on your hard drive; instead, they are abstract entities
you work
with through an intermediary program like RoboJournal. The intermediary
program
relays data between the client (your computer) and the actual journal
database
residing on the host. While the journal appears to be on your computer,
this is
not truly the case unless you are running the database server on
localhost.
Since the journal databases are abstract entities, it is normally
difficult to
extract data from them unless you dump the entire database to disk as a
file
(the most common backup method). Fortunately, RoboJournal
provides a way to directly extract journal content in a form that can
be easily backed up or copied.</p>
<p>To begin, select
the entry you wish to export (or any entry, if you wish to export the
entire
journal) and click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Export Entry</span>
toolbar button.<img alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_export1.png"
 class="screenshot" height="584" width="750"><span class="caption">Figure
1: Select an entry (indicated
by the
large oval) and click the <strong>Export Content</strong> toolbar
button to
display the Export Content dialog.</span></p>
<p>This action displays the Export Content window:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1" src="img/screens/mw_export2.png"
 class="screenshot" height="591" width="751"><span class="caption">Figure
2: The Export Content window
is
displayed with the selected entry already pre-loaded.</span></p>
<p>RoboJournal's export functionality has been dramatically improved
in version 0.5. The new design features a page-based
interface,
much like the new <a href="getting_started.html#create">Journal Creator</a>
and
the new <a href="preferences.html">Preferences</a> window introduced
in version
0.4. The Export Content window offers a menu with three items on the
left side of its interface with its remaining space devoted to options
related to the currently-selected item. Unlike the old entry exporter
(which separated functionality by
use of a
tabbed widget in a way that could potentially be confusing) the new
design
separates functionality by page; each page is dedicated to a a specific
type of
export function. <br>
</p>
<p>The Export Content window always displays the <strong>Export
single entry</strong> page by default. You can switch to a different
page at any time by clicking a different item on the list. When you
click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Export</span> button,
RoboJournal applies actions that are relevant to the current page only
(all settings on inactive pages are ignored).&nbsp; The following
sections describe the various pages (and their functions) in greater
detail. <br>
</p>
<h2 id="Single">Exporting a Single Entry</h2>
<p>When initially opened, the Export Content window is automatically
configured to
export the
entry you previously selected from the Timeline on the RoboJournal main
window: <img alt="Figure 3" src="img/screens/export_single.png"
 class="screenshot" height="453" width="576"><span class="caption">Figure
3: The "Export
Single
Entry" page allows you to export the current (selected) entry from the
main
window.</span></p>
<p>If you need to change any of the settings (including file type or
export
destination), you must do so before beginning the export operation.
Exporting a single entry is designed to be extremely simple since
most
configuration requirements are pre-set in advance. The available
options control the output file properties.<br>
</p>
<p>Generally, you only
need to
click the <strong>Export</strong> button (shown in Figure 3) after
selecting
the entry you wish to export from the Timeline on the
RoboJournal main window. The Export Content window provides output and
automatically closes once its task is finished.</p>
<h3 id="L131">Single Export Options</h3>
<p>The following table explains each option on the Export Single Entry
page in
greater detail:</p>
<table border="0">
  <col> <col> <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field determines
what name the entry content is saved under on your hard drive. This
field is read-only by default and cannot be edited directly unless the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Allow custom filename</span> option is
enabled.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Location</td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Export Location</strong> field
lists the path to the folder where the output file will be saved. Click
the <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of this field to
select a different folder.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The Export Format options determine which type
of file is created during the export operation. The <strong>HTML</strong>
option produces a HTML4-compliant document that is viewable in any web
browser. The <strong>Plain text</strong> option produces a text file
that is compatible with any text editor (e.g. Vim, Notepad, Emacs,
etc.).
      <p>For best results, you should use HTML output because it
preserves all document formatting (bold, italic, etc. text) while plain
text output does not. As such, the option you should choose depends on
your requirements. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include entry date in filename</td>
      <td class="right">This option appends the current date, in <em>day
of week_mm-dd-yyyy</em> format, to the filename. For best results, you
should leave this option enabled each time you export an entry.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include journal in filename</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option inserts the journal
name at the beginning of the Filename field (i.e. <em>journal name</em>_entry
title_entry date). You should leave this option enabled for best
results because the resulting filename makes it easy to group exported
entries from the same journal together and it provides a way for you to
easily recognize which journal an entry came from.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename</td>
      <td class="right">When checked, this option allows you to
directly edit the <strong>Filename</strong> field's contents. You
should enable this feature if it is necessary to assign a custom
filename to an output file.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="Multi">Exporting the Entire Journal</h2>
<p>In addition to exporting entries one at a time, RoboJournal also
allows you
to export an entire journal at once. This task can be done in two
different
ways. RoboJournal can merge each entry into a single large file (the
"original"
method featured since version 0.3). In version 0.5, RoboJournal
introduces a
new bulk export method where a journal can be exported as a set of
discrete
files. This new feature produces the same results as manually exporting
the
entire journal one entry at a time but is much more efficient and
convenient. Under this new method, each
entry
is saved individually and is placed with the others in a predetermined
destination folder bearing the name of the journal and the export date.
</p>
<p>You can access the bulk-export function through the following
procedure:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from the
Timeline and click the <strong>Export Content</strong>
toolbar button (as shown in Figure 1) to display the Export Content
window. It does not matter which entry you choose to begin this process.</li>
  <li>The Export Content window is displayed. Select the <strong>Export
Entire Journal</strong> list item on the left side of the Export
Content window to display the appropriate options:<img alt="Figure 4"
 src="img/screens/export_multi.png" class="screenshot" height="453"
 width="576"><span class="caption">Figure 4: The "Export Entire
Journal" page allows you to output the contents of an entire journal in
one simple process.</span></li>
  <li>Adjust the options in the Export Location, Export Format, and
Export Options groups if necessary. Each of these settings and their
effects are addressed in-depth in the Bulk Export Options section. The
default
configuration produces a single HTML-based file (with the journal name
and the export date in the filename) with all journal entries arranged
in descending order.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to continue. The Export
Content window provides output and automatically closes once its task
is finished.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="L253">Bulk Export Options</h3>
<p>The following table contains a full explanation of all options that
can be
applied to bulk export operations and the effects each option has on
the output
file(s):</p>
<table border="0">
  <col> <col> <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Filename<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Filename</strong> field determines
what name the entry content is saved under on your hard drive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export location</td>
      <td class="right">This field determines where the output file is
stored. If the <strong>Keep individual entries separate</strong>
option is enabled, the output files are stored in a custom folder
(bearing the journal name and the export date) within the directory
specified in the <strong>Export location</strong> field. Click the <strong>Browse</strong>
button to the right of this field to select a different folder. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Export Format</td>
      <td class="right">The Export Format options determine which type

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Include export date<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">If enabled, this option causes the current
export date to be included in the filename (i.e. sample_journal_<span
 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">09-03-2013</span>.html). This feature
is useful for archival purposes since it indicates what a journal
contained on a specific date. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Keep individual entries separate</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option causes RoboJournal to
export the current journal as a set of discrete files, with one entry
per file. Enabling this option disables many other settings on the <strong>Export
entire journal</strong> page that are only relevant to the task of
creating a single large export file.
      <p>The output files from the export operation are saved in a
custom folder contained within the current <strong>Export location</strong>
directory. RoboJournal automatically creates the export folder during
the procedure so there is no need to manually create it in advance.
Each file in the folder is marked with the journal name, its position
in the series, and the entry title (i.e.
sample_journal_1_of_15_sample_entry.html). </p>
      <p>Exporting the journal as a series of individual entries always
arranges the content in ascending chronological order, with the oldest
entry being the first item in the set. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">When selected, this option allows you to
directly edit the <strong>Filename</strong> field's contents. You
should enable this feature if the situation requires you to assign a
custom filename to the output file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Sort in ascending/descending order<sup>*</sup></td>
      <td class="right">These two options determine the chronological
order in which entries are merged into the output file. Arranging
entries in ascending order causes the oldest entry to be listed first
while descending order places the latest entry first in the sequence.
RoboJournal chooses the descending arrangement by default because it
assumes the most recent entries are the most important to the reader
(and should therefore be listed first). </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p class="footnote">* RoboJournal locks these options (and ignores
their
current settings) while the <strong>Keep individual entries separate</strong>
option is enabled because the affected options are non-applicable to
multiple
files.</p>
<h2 id="L370">Creating a Backup of Your Journal with MySQLDump</h2>
<p>RoboJournal 0.5 introduces a new feature that allows you to easily
create a
backup of the current active journal. Backing up a journal is useful
because it
allows you to "freeze" the current condition of your journal at a
specific
moment in time. You can then use this backup at a later time to restore
or
revert your journal to the state it was in when the backup was created.
For
best results, you should create backups on a regular basis and store
them in a
safe place in case the working copy of the database becomes corrupt or
is lost
due to equipment failure.</p>
<p>RoboJournal uses a utility called MySQLDump to create the backups
(MySQLDump
is usually distributed along with MySQL). In the past, this task
required you
to invoke MySQLDump manually via the command line but RoboJournal is
now
capable of directly interfacing with MySQLDump through an easy-to-use
graphical
user interface. At the moment, RoboJournal offers no direct way to
restore
databases from backups but that feature is planned for future versions.</p>
<p>You can export your journals by completing the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>On the RoboJournal main window, select an entry from the
Chronological Entry List and click the <strong>Export Content</strong>
toolbar button (as shown in Figure 1) to display the Export Content
window. For this procedure, it does not matter which entry you choose
from the list. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Backup MySQL Journal</strong> list item on the
left side of the Export Content window to display the backup-related
options (Figure 5): <img style="width: 576px; height: 453px;"
 class="screenshot" alt="Figure x" title="Figure x"
 src="img/screens/export_dump.png"><span class="caption">Figure 5: The
"Backup MySQL Journal" page provides an easy-to-use interface for
MySQLDump.</span></li>
  <li>Make all necessary changes. The default settings produce a .sql
file bearing the journal name and the export date (i.e.
sample_journal_09-04-2013)&nbsp; that is saved in your home folder's
Documents sub-directory ("My Documents" on Windows XP and older). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Export</strong> button to begin the operation:
    <img alt="Figure 6" src="img/screens/export_dump2.png"
 class="screenshot" height="453" width="576"><span class="caption">Figure
6: Click the <strong>Export</strong> button when ready.</span></li>
  <li>Enter the root password for MySQL when prompted and click the <strong>OK</strong>
button to continue:<img alt="Figure 7"
 src="img/screens/export_dump3.png" class="screenshot" height="128"
 width="266"><span class="caption">Figure 7: Enter the current MySQL
server's root password to continue.</span> RoboJournal requires
root-level access for MySQLDump operations because it must lock the
current journal's tables (a function that is normally restricted to the
root account) before it can complete the dump operation.&nbsp;This
prevents the possibility of edit collisions, which are attempts by two
or more users to modify the same database simultaneously. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The Export Content window closes itself once its task is
complete.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="L419">Backup Options<br>
</h3>
<p>The following table contains a full explanation of all options that
can be
applied to backup operations and the effects each option has on the
output
file:</p>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Output filename<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">The <strong>Output filename</strong> field
determines the name
the entry content is saved under on your hard drive. This file always
has a <em>.sql</em> extension.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Allow custom filename<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">If checked, RoboJournal allows you to choose
your own filename by directly editing the contents of the <strong>Output
filename</strong> field (which are otherwise read-only). Despite the
freedom this feature offers, RoboJournal strictly enforces certain
guidelines:<br>
      <br>
When you click
the <strong>Export</strong> button, RoboJournal corrects any errors it
detects in the filename, including replacing spaces with underscore
("_") characters and removing forbidden characters like [semi]colons,
slashes, etc. As you edit the text in the field, RoboJournal constantly
ensures the filename you have chosen ends with an appropriate <i>.sql</i>
extension at all times.<br>
      <br>
When the Allow <strong>custom filename field</strong> is unchecked,
RoboJournal utilizes a <i>[journal
name]_[export date].sql</i> naming convention (i.e.
sample_journal_09-23-2013) for all output files. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Output file location<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">This field determines where the output file is
saved (the Documents folder in your home directory is the default
location). Click the <strong>Browse</strong> button to the right of
this field to select a different folder.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Path to MySQLDump utility<br>
      </td>
      <td class="right">This field lists the absolute path to the
MySQLDump executable on your computer. Click the <strong>Browse</strong>
button to the right of this field to manually locate MySQLDump. <br>
      <br>
While
running on Windows, RoboJournal restricts the file browser to
mysqldump.exe but there are no such restrictions on Linux/Unix because
executables have no extension on those operating systems. Once you
have located the MySQLDump executable with the file browser,
RoboJournal saves the selected pathname so you will not need to browse
for it again.<br>
