<h2 id="preferences_overview">Preferences Overview</h2>

<p>RoboJournal's preferences system has been completely redesigned into a
modular interface (starting in version 0.4). This new design offers improved
efficiency and an increased potential for expansion. All related items have
been grouped into different categories. In this documentation, each category is
known as a "page". To switch to a different page, click on its name in the list
on the left side of the Preferences window. The title of the Preferences window
indicates which page you are currently viewing (e.g. Preferences -- General;
Preferences -- Appearance).</p>

<p>Since each page is of a different size (due to each one having a different
number of options), RoboJournal's preference window automatically pads out the
extra space on a page if necessary. If a page is larger than the current size
of the window, the Preferences window utilizes scrollbars to allow you to
access controls that would otherwise be hidden. Scrollbars are only used if a
page will not fit the current window size; to eliminate the scrollbars, you
must resize the Preferences window to the point where it is large enough to
accommodate the entire page. </p>

<p>The Preferences window is fully resizable; click and drag the lower right
corner to resize the window. If you resize the window, RoboJournal
automatically records size changes in your configuration file size and
automatically loads the new size each time the window is subsequently
displayed. If the new size data becomes unavailable for some reason, the
Preferences window reverts to its original size of 575x525 pixels.</p>

<h2 id="general_page"><em>General</em> Page</h2>

<p>The General page contains options that control the behavior of the entire
program. The General page is always shown by default whenever the Preferences
window is displayed. Otherwise, the General page is displayed when you click
the <strong>General</strong> list item on the left side of the Preferences
window:</p>

<h3 id="global_preferences">Global Preferences</h3>

<p>All options in the <strong>Global Preferences</strong> group affect
underlying program behavior and appearance.</p>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Always suggest default settings</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option requires RoboJournal to
        automatically populate affected form fields with default settings
        whenever a form capable of using these settings (e.g. New Connection
        dialog) is displayed. This action is <em>not</em> the same as mandating
        default settings because it is often possible to override the defaults
        on a form-by-form basis. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Always show confirmation dialogs</td>
      <td class="right">This security measure forces RoboJournal to show all
        confirmation dialogs in situations where they may be triggered. This
        practice helps to prevent accidental deletions and other data loss in
        situations where carelessness can cause problems. You are
        <em>strongly</em> encouraged to leave this option enabled at all times. 

        <p>However, you should be aware that some confirmation dialogs are
        mandatory and are always shown (if triggered) whether this setting is
        enabled or not.</p>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td class="left">Show labels on toolbar buttons</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this setting causes every toolbar to
        display their buttons with both icons and text labels (default
        setting). Unchecking this option causes all toolbar buttons to display
        their icon only. Users may prefer icon-only mode because it saves space
        and usually eliminates the need for the toolbar overflow menu. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Display current journal name in title bar</td>
      <td class="right">This feature simply shows the name of the current
        journal in the main window title bar (i.e. sample_journal -
        RoboJournal). If unchecked, the title bar simply says, "RoboJournal"
        whether a connection is active or not.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Display alternating row colors in lists</td>
      <td class="right">This option causes all lists (specifically the
        Chronological Entry List and the search output list) to use alternating
        background colors. This looks good on some color schemes but is
        completely unreadable on others (so you may wish to disable it in some
        situations).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Display Tag Reminder window during login</td>

        the <a href="tags.html#tag_reminder">Tag Reminder</a> window
        immediately after login under the appropriate conditions (i.e. if the
        journal contains one or more untagged entries). The Tag Reminder window
        is completely suppressed while the <strong>Display Tag Reminder window
        during login</strong> box is unchecked.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="left">Toolbar docking position</td>
      <td class="right">This drop-down list controls the default location of
        the main window's toolbar. This setting is persistent between sessions. 

        <p>It is possible to change the location of the toolbar during runtime
        by dragging it to a new position or using the setting in the Window ≻
        Toolbar position list, but these changes revert to the default setting
        the next time RoboJournal is used.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="backend">Backend (Database)</h3>

<p>The backend option controls which database engine RoboJournal should use.
For instance, choosing "MySQL" from the list causes RoboJournal to switch to
MySQL mode. You must switch the backend before you may work with a different
type of database (like SQLite). RoboJournal may use only one backend at a
time.</p>

<h3 id="date_and_time">Date and Time</h3>

<p>The <strong>Date and Time</strong> group controls all settings that
determine how RoboJournal processes date and time data. </p>

        <p>RoboJournal does not display timestamps if this setting is disabled.
        RoboJournal will <em>not</em> store timestamps for entries made while
        this option is disabled. Entries with no timestamp data are indicated
        as being made at an "[unknown time]". There is currently no way to
        update timestamps on existing entries (other than manually editing the

      <td class="left">Preferred date format</td>
      <td class="right">This drop-down list determines which date format
        RoboJournal should use in the entry header and Chronological Entry

              scientific context). </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Certain date-related functions in RoboJournal (most notably the date
        column in the search results) override the preferred date format
        setting. These exceptions use the date format setting of your operating
        system instead.</p>

<h2 id="journal_page"><em>Journal</em> Page</h2>

<p>The Journal page contains options that govern journal behavior and general
user preferences. The Journal page is displayed when you click the
<strong>Journal</strong> list item on the left side of the Preferences
window:</p>

<h3 id="entry_settings">Entry Settings and Range</h3>

<p>This group contains settings that define the current entry range (the
timespan of entries shown in the Chronological Entry List). The purpose of the
entry range feature is to limit how many entries are shown at once in order to
prevent the Chronological Entry List from being too long to easily navigate.
For instance, setting an entry range of two years causes RoboJournal to show
all entries made within the last two years (including the current year). As
time passes, older entries are excluded from the allotted range while the
newest ones are included. Disabling the entry range causes RoboJournal to
display all entries from the current journal (regardless of age) in the
Chronological Entry List. This group also has settings for miscellaneous
behavior associated with entries.</p>

    <tr>
      <td class="left">Show all entries in journal</td>

      <td class="left">Show entries from the last:</td>

      <td class="right">This feature (if enabled) causes the current entry
        range to be displayed on the main window statusbar along with the
        current entry count (i.e. "<em>x</em> Entries : <em>y</em> Years"). If
        the entry range function is disabled, this checkbox locks and is
        unavailable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Select entry node icon</td>
      <td class="right">This allows you to select the icon used to represent

<h3 id="user_info">User Information</h3>

<p>The <strong>User Information</strong> group contains settings that pertain
to the user.</p>

<table border="0">

  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Your full name (as you would like it to appear)</td>
      <td class="right"><p>This text box is meant to display your full name as
        you would like it to appear in the entry header. For example, you would
        probably set your full name to "John Doe" (or something similar) if
        your username were "john_doe". Unlike the username assigned to your
        journal, this value may contain spaces and uppercase characters. Your
        username is displayed in the header instead if this field is left
        blank. </p>

        <p>This field is normally populated during first-run but its value may
        be changed at any time.</p>
      </td>

      <td class="right">This setting determines which avatar icon (male or
        female) is displayed next to your username in the main window status
        bar.

        may be changed at any time.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="highlighting">Highlighting</h3>

<p>The options in the <strong>Highlighting</strong> group control how
RoboJournal highlights occurrences of a search term. This feature is designed
to mimic traditional highlighter pens; all instances of a search term in an
entry are displayed with a bright colored background to make them easier to
locate in the text.</p>

<table border="0">
  <caption></caption>
  <col>

  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td class="right">This list allows you to select the highlight color. The

        that particular color.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>

<p>The <strong>Behavior</strong> group contains general options that relate to
journal behavior.</p>

<table border="0">
  <caption></caption>
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Group journal entries by day</td>
      <td class="right">This option gives you the ability to sort entries by
        day instead of by month (which is the default behavior). Under normal
        conditions, entries are displayed with the date and title merged
        together (i.e. "January 1: Sample Entry"). Grouping entries by day adds
        another sub-category; in the aforementioned example, the entry "Sample
        Entry" would be a separate node listed under "January 1" instead of the
        two being merged together into a single node. 

        <p>This option is useful if you frequently post more than one entry per
        day and would like greater control of how such entries are
        displayed.</p>

    <tr>
      <td class="left">Display most recent entry automatically</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, RoboJournal displays the most recent entry

        would like it to appear)</strong> text box. This checkbox automatically
        disables itself and locks if the full name value is cleared. Inversely,
        this setting re-enables itself if a new full name value is entered. You
        may also disable this setting manually and leave the full name value
        intact.</td>

  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="editor_page"><em>Editor</em> Page</h2>

<p>The Editor page contains settings that affect the behavior and performance
of the Editor window, including post-processing features, appearance settings,
and spell check integration. The Editor page is displayed when you click the
<strong>Editor</strong> list item on the left side of the Preferences
window:</p>

<p><img alt="RoboJournal Preferences: Editor Page"

Window — Editor Page</span></p>

<h3 id="post_processing">Post Processing</h3>

<p>The options in the <strong>Post-Processing</strong> group manipulate the
text of new or revised entries after they have been saved. These functions
perform necessary corrections and cleanup operations to body text as a means to
improve appearance and fix common errors. In all instances, post-processing
functionality looks for specific error patterns and then applies changes to all
instances of these patterns it detects in the body text. </p>

<p>Since these changes are only applied after an entry is saved,
post-processing will <em>not</em> affect old entries that were made before the
post-processing features were introduced or were made while post-processing
features were disabled. Post-processing is applied once after an entry has been
saved in order to improve efficiency. The only way to apply post-processing to
old entries is to open them in the editor and then save them again.</p>

<table border="0">
  <caption></caption>
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Remove unnecessary whitespace from entries</td>
      <td class="right">This function removes extra line breaks between
        paragraphs and trims extra space from the bottom of the entry.
        Whitespace removal also eliminates extra spaces between words (since
        all words should only be separated by one space). 

        <p>This feature is still semi-experimental and may occasionally produce
        unexpected results (a reliable fix is to edit the entry and save it
        again).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Use HTML-compliant dashes and hyphens</td>
      <td class="right">This feature ensures the correct use of dashes and
        hyphenation in entries. These are impossible to add with a regular
        keyboard (without resorting to key combinations) so this function does
        it for you. It replaces the common workaround for long dashes (i.e. --)
        with HTML-compliant long dash characters (i.e. — ) and removes any
        unnecessary spacing. Dashes between numbers are replaced with a proper
        medium-length dash (i.e. 1–2 instead of 1-2).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Use smart (curly) quotation marks</td>
      <td class="right">This feature replaces instances of "straight" quotation
        marks with “curly” quotation marks. Post-processing also affects
        grammatical contractions and possessive nouns (i.e. won't becomes
        won’t; John's becomes John’s). </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Apply miscellaneous formatting options</td>
      <td class="right">Miscellaneous formatting applies post-processing
        features that are not easily categorized. These convert three or more
        consecutive periods into a true ellipsis character (…) and formalizes
        number notation (i.e. 12<sup>th</sup>, 101<sup>st</sup>).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>

<p>The <strong>Use custom theme font in the editor</strong> option causes the
editor to use the same font/font size as the entry output pane in the main
window. This improves consistency and helps you to preview how your entry will
look once it has been saved. This option is locked (as shown in the screenshot
above) if RoboJournal is not presently configured to use a custom style.</p>

<h3 id="spellcheck">Spell Check</h3>

<p>RoboJournal's spell check feature scans the contents of the editor each time
a new word is entered and applies a wavy red underline to all spelling errors
it detects. Spell check is not automatically enabled during first-run. To
enable spell check, you must first select a dictionary for it to use (refer to
the "<a href="#select_dict">Selecting a Dictionary for the First Time</a>"
section).</p>

<h4 id="select_dict">Selecting a Dictionary for the First Time</h4>

<p>RoboJournal automatically copies the built-in US English dictionary to the
".robojournal" folder in your home directory during first-run. The
<strong>Select Dictionary</strong> file browser always starts in that location
because it is guaranteed to contain at least one valid dictionary. Although US
English is the default language, RoboJournal supports other languages as well.
You may acquire other dictionaries from the Internet but every dictionary
<em>must</em> consist of a DIC/AFF file pair in order to be compatible with
RoboJournal. Any dictionary designed for use with the Hunspell spell check
engine is fully compatible with RoboJournal. For best results, both the DIC and
AFF files for each dictionary should be stored in the same directory.</p>

<p>Once you select a DIC file with the <strong>Select Dictionary</strong> file
browser, RoboJournal attempts to find the appropriate AFF file automatically.
If RoboJournal cannot locate an AFF file to go with the DIC file you selected,
you are instructed to find this AFF file manually (a <strong>Locate AFF
File</strong> file browser is displayed after Step 3 in the following
procedure). </p>

<p>Once you are on the Editor page in the RoboJournal Preferences window,
perform the following procedure to enable spell check:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Enable spell check functionality</strong> checkbox. The
    other spellcheck-related options are unlocked and the <strong>Select
    Dictionary</strong> file browser is displayed:<img

    src="img/screens/select_dictionary.png" width="779" height="478"
    class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: The <strong>Select
    Dictionary</strong> file dialog</span> 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> If you are using an operating system other than
    Windows 7, the Select Dictionary dialog will look different than it does in
    Figure 4.</div>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to a directory that contains dictionary files (if necessary).
  </li>
  <li>Select the dictionary file you want to use and click the
    <strong>Open</strong> button to continue.</li>
  <li>The path to the chosen dictionary is now properly set in the
    <strong>Select spell check dictionary</strong> field on the Editor
  page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once a dictionary has been selected, you may switch to a different
dictionary at any time by clicking the <strong>Browse</strong> (folder icon)
button immediately to the right of the <strong>Select spell check
dictionary</strong> field. The <strong>Select Dictionary</strong> dialog is
displayed and you may select the dictionary you wish to use. Click the
<strong>Open</strong> button to update the current value with the new choice.
The new dictionary becomes active when you click the <strong>OK</strong> button
on the RoboJournal Preferences window.</p>

<h2 id="appearance_page"><em>Appearance</em> Page</h2>

<p>The Appearance page controls the appearance and font settings of rendered
entries in the output pane on the main window. The Appearance page is displayed
when you click the <strong>Appearance</strong> list item on the left side of
the Preferences window:</p>

<p><img alt="RoboJournal Preferences: Appearance Page"

class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 5: RoboJournal Preferences
Window — Appearance Page</span></p>

<h3 id="enable_styles">Enabling Custom Styles</h3>

<p>All custom styles are disabled by default. Instead, RoboJournal uses a
generic sans-serif font for text and system colors to indicate the
header/highlighted text. The default settings are generally consistent with the
overall system theme currently in use on your computer.</p>

<p>The entire <strong>Style Options</strong> group is locked while the
<strong>Use custom font and/or background image</strong> box is unchecked.
Checking this box unlocks the group and allows you to define custom settings.
Certain background-related options (<strong>Tile background image</strong> and
<strong>Apply background image to entry list</strong>) will remain locked
indefinitely unless a background image has been set.</p>

<h4 id="select_color">Selecting a Font Color</h4>

<p>Use the following procedure to select a font color:</p>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Choose</strong> button on the Appearance page in the
    RoboJournal Preferences window. The Select Color dialog is displayed:<img
    alt="Color chooser dialog" src="img/screens/color_chooser.png" width="506"
    height="383" class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: Select
    Color dialog box. This design is universal across all operating
    systems.</span></li>
  <li>Select a preset color from the <strong>Basic colors</strong> list
    <em>or</em> use the targeting crosshair to select a custom color from the
    full spectrum (use the vertical slider on the far right side of the dialog
    to set color brightness). </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to apply the selected color.</li>
</ol>

<div class="FYI">
<strong>FYI</strong>: The color selected through the above procedure is also
used for the date box header and tag header backgrounds. Because of this, both
headers display their text in the <em>inverse</em> color of their backgrounds
in order to ensure maximum contrast and readability.</div>

<h4 id="set_bgimage">Setting a Background Image</h4>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Browse</strong> (folder) button in the <strong>Style

  <li>Navigate to a folder that contains image files (*.png, *.jpg, *.bmp, or
    *.gif) and select the desired image by clicking on its filename. </li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Open</strong> button.</li>
  <li>Your choice is now displayed in the <strong>Select background image from
    disk</strong> field. The background is applied after you click the
    <strong>OK</strong> button in the RoboJournal Preferences window.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Click the <strong>Tile background image</strong> checkbox if
    you want the background image to be repeated in the entry output pane.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Click the <strong>Apply background image to entry
    list</strong> checkbox if you want to apply the background to the
    Chronological Entry List. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="clear_bgimage">Clearing a Background Image</h4>
<ol class="list">
  <li>Click the <strong>Clear Background</strong> button in the <strong>Style

<h2 id="export_settings"><em>Export Settings</em> Page</h2>

<p>The options on the Export Settings page allow you to control how exported
entries are processed. Since this function takes database content and uses it
to create documents in both HTML and plain-text format, any changes made to the
options on this page will not affect entries that have already been exported.
</p>

<p>The Export Settings page is displayed when you click the <strong>Export
Settings</strong> list item on the left side of the Preferences window:</p>

<p><img alt="RoboJournal Preferences: Export Page"
src="img/screens/preferences_export.png" width="642" height="604"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 10: RoboJournal Preferences
Window — Export Settings Page</span></p>

<h3 id="html_behavior">HTML Behavior</h3>

<p>The HTML Behavior group contains options that affect the visual appearance
of exported HTML documents. As such, these settings are entirely optional.
These options are <em>not</em> applied to plain text files.</p>

<table border="0">
  <caption></caption>
  <col>
  <col>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Use rounded corners on date/timestamp header</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this option causes the entry exporter to
        apply rounded corners (using Cascading Style Sheets) to the
        date/timestamp header in both the single entry export and full journal
        export functions. This function is purely decorative and may not be
        visible on older browsers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="left">Use system colors in exported HTML files</td>
      <td class="right">If checked, this function applies the system colors for
        highlighted text (foreground) and selected color (background) to
        exported documents. The purpose of this setting is to allow the
        exported text to more closely resemble the entry as it is shown in the
        entry output pane. 

        <p>If unchecked, black text is used for the foreground and a neutral
        gray is used for the background.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="fonts_and_units">Fonts and Units</h3>

<p>RoboJournal supports separate fonts for headers and entries in exported HTML
documents. In normal situations, sans-serif font should be used for headers and
serif font for text. Fonts are chosen through the <strong>Preferred HTML
Fonts</strong> group while sizes/units are determined by the <strong>Font Sizes
and Units</strong> group. </p>

<p>To select a font, click on the <strong>Select header font</strong> or
<strong>Select body text font</strong> lists (depending on which one you want
to change). The font lists contain all fonts installed on your system; scroll
through the current list until you locate the desired font. On Windows,
RoboJournal uses Verdana (header) and Times New Roman (body) as the default
fonts.</p>

<p>Fonts may be displayed in point size (pt) and em units. Point size is a
fixed size traditionally used in word processing and print media; 1pt is
generally equivalent to 1/72 inch. Em units are more scalable than pt and refer
to current font size; 1em = 12 pt, 2em = 24pt, etc. Even though 1em is always
equivalent to 12pt, the apparent size of em increases in proportion to general
font size; 1em appears larger under a base font size of 120% than under a size
of 100%. In contrast, point size always remains consistent regardless of base
font size. Generally, you should use pt if you intend to print your exported
journal entries while em units are more appropriate if readability across
different devices is your highest priority. </p>

<p>The available font sizes depend on the unit currently in use. Changing the
unit assigned to header or body fonts causes the affected available size list
to refresh and display new values appropriate for that unit. Select the desired
value from the list to set a font size.</p>

<h3 id="export_preview">Export Preview</h3>

<p>After changing fonts, font sizes, font units, or HTML Behavior settings, you
may preview your changes by clicking the <strong>Preview Export
Settings</strong> button. The Export Preview window is displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="Export Preview Window" src="img/screens/export_preview.png"
width="613" height="529" class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure
11: Export Preview dialog displaying sample text</span></p>

<p>The Export Preview window allows you to "test" new settings before saving
them. The current settings of the Export Settings page are used to render a
sample entry that contains a title, date/timestamp header, and several
paragraphs of body text. The body text is an excerpt from the classic Latin
<em>Lorem Ipsum</em> text used throughout the print industry since the 1500s.
Click the <strong>Close</strong> button to exit the Export Preview. </p>

<h2 id="mysql_settings_page"><em>MySQL Settings</em> Page</h2>

<p>The MySQL page contains options that define and control all settings related
to MySQL. The MySQL Settings page is displayed when you click the <strong>MySQL
Settings</strong> list item on the left side of the Preferences window: </p>

<p><img alt="RoboJournal Preferences: MySQL Page"
src="img/screens/preferences_mysql.png" width="642" height="604"
class="screenshot"><span class="caption_wide">Figure 12: RoboJournal
Preferences Window — MySQL Settings Page</span></p>

<p>The <strong>Default Account</strong> group contains options that determine
the default account for MySQL connections, including the default Host,
Database, Port, and Username to use if RoboJournal is configured to always
suggest default settings. The <strong>Default</strong> button (to the right of
the Port field) is an easy way to reset the Port field to its default value of
"3306" in case you previously changed it and need to change it back. </p>

<p>Enabling the <strong>Allow root logins on host</strong> option overrides the
security protocol that prevents users from logging in as the MySQL root user.
This option should not be used unless absolutely necessary since the root
account has full control over all database functions (including those which
have the potential to be harmful). By design, RoboJournal places restrictions
on regular user accounts for security purposes.</p>
