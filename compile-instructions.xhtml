<h1>RoboJournal Compile and Installation Guide</h1>

<p>Thank you for downloading RoboJournal. The purpose of this documentation is
to assist users in the process of compiling RoboJournal from its source code.
Since building RoboJournal requires a Qt environment with full MySQL support,
this documentation also explains how to properly prepare and compile Qt from
its source code. If you need to compile Qt, instructions and guidelines for
doing so are given in the "How to Build Qt with MySQL Support" section.
Internet access may be required to fetch one or more required components.</p>

<p>This documentation uses various styles to differentiate portions of the
text. Sections with a <span class="console">black background</span> are literal
commands meant to be entered at a command prompt (xterm or cmd.exe). In
practical usage, the entire command inside a black section is meant to be one
line with absolutely no line breaks, even if the section wraps to the next line
in the documentation. Sections with a <span class="arg">green background</span>
are used to reference specific portions of a command but are not full commands
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="prereq">  Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before you can compile RoboJournal, you must have <em>all</em> of the
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>RoboJournal source tarball (and any extra software required to unpack the
    tar.gz archive). The current stable version at the time of this writing is
    0.4.1.<br />
    <br />
    Alternatively, you can acquire RoboJournal's source code by cloning the
    contents of the <a
    href="https://github.com/pwizard2/robojournal">RoboJournal GitHub
    repository</a> directly into a folder. Be advised that the RoboJournal
    "experimental" branch on GitHub frequently contains components that are
    incomplete and/or buggy because they are in an active state of development.
    Because of this, those who wish to get RoboJournal from GitHub should clone
    from the "master" branch that is kept synchronized with the current stable
    version. </li>
  <li>A Qt ≥ 4.7 environment to compile against. Consult the "Preparing Qt"
    section in this documentation for details on what is required.</li>
  <li>GNU Compiler Toolkit. On Linux, the package containing the full kit is
    called build-essential on several distros, including Ubuntu and Debian. In
    addition to compilers, build-essential contains other utilities that will
    help you create a software package; you should only package your custom
    build if you plan to eventually redistribute it.<br />


    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> Windows users should use the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">MinGW toolkit</a>
    (Minimalist GNU for Windows) instead of other compiler toolchains. This
    guide only provides instructions for MinGW. Alternatives may work fine but
    they should still be considered experimental/unsupported for the purpose of
    building RoboJournal. </div>
  </li>
  <li>A text editor (<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is
    recommended) if you wish to use the Build Helper Script to compile for
    Windows. You will need to edit the script before using it for the first
    time. The Linux Build Helper Script (linux_compile.pl) rarely requires any
    modification prior to use.</li>
  <li>A reasonable amount of experience with command line interfaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>RoboJournal has been tested extensively on Linux and Windows XP (and newer).
RoboJournal should operate reliably and correctly on the aforementioned
operating systems but others should be considered experimental at this point.
If you build and deploy RoboJournal on an experimental operating system, you
should be ready for unexpected bugs even if everything appears to work
correctly.</p>

<p>If you wish to use standard RoboJournal, you should use pre-compiled
binaries for best results. There is an installer available for Microsoft
Windows and you may obtain packages compatible with Debian-based Linux from the
Debian repositories. These packages work with Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or any other
Debian-based Linux. You should try these options first to see if they work. If
not, or if you are using an operating system for which no RoboJournal installer
package exists, your only option will be to build from source. The
"robojournal" package in Debian is often one or two versions behind, so Debian
users will need to build from source if the latest version is not available in
the unstable or experimental repositories.</p>

<h2 id="prepare">  Preparing Qt</h2>

<p>You should compile Qt <em>only</em> if you don't have a set of suitable Qt
libraries available for use with RoboJournal.  Suitable Qt libraries are
defined as being compiled for your correct operating system/system architecture
and contain complete driver support for both MySQL and SQLite. Linux and
Windows Qt environments are not interchangeable; you may <em>not</em> use a set
of Windows libraries on Linux and vice versa. A complete Qt environment is
much harder to find ready-made for Microsoft Windows, so Windows users will
probably have to compile their own from scratch. <strong>The official Qt
Software Development Kit (SDK) offered by Digia is unsuitable for building
RoboJournal because the SDK lacks adequate database support.</strong> </p>

<p>Linux users should check their distro repositories first to see if there is
a complete set (containing the core SQL module and separate packages for MySQL
and SQLite drivers) of Qt libraries available.  If so, they may be used to
compile RoboJournal and building from source is unnecessary. </p>
<hr />

<h3 id="config">How to Build Qt with MySQL Support</h3>

<p>Since Qt is modular, the capabilities of a Qt environment are limited by
what you decide to include during its configuration process. In other words, if
you omit support for a SQL driver, that driver will not be available in the
finished build. SQLite support is built-in and requires no headers/libraries
(although you still have to include it in the configure command). However, you
must specify the path to the headers/libraries for all other drivers you wish
to include.</p>

<p>Building a custom Qt environment from source requires all of the
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Basic (or better) proficiency with command line interfaces.</li>
  <li>MySQL headers and libraries. Headers consist of the *.h files found in
    the MySQL include directory; libraries are found in the file libmysql.lib.
    The location of these objects on your system (assuming they are available)
    will vary depending on your situation. 

    <div class="FYI">
    FYI: If you are using a 32-bit compiler, (MinGW) MySQL libraries
    <em>must</em> be 32-bit even on 64-bit Windows systems. Compiling against
    64-bit libraries will cause the build attempt to fail because MinGW can
    only produce 32-bit binaries. However, if you can obtain 64-bit compilers
    (64-bit GNU toolkit or MinGW-w64) you could then produce a fully 64-bit
    RoboJournal binary based on 64-bit Qt and MySQL libraries. However, this
    should be considered experimental. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Qt (≥ 4.7) source code from the Qt Project's <a
    href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">website</a>. Since the source code
    comes packaged in a zip or tar.gz file, you also need the appropriate
    software to extract these archives. </li>
  <li>Perl (<a
    href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">ActivePerl</a> is
    recommended) if building on Windows. The built-in Perl interpreter included
    in most Linux distributions is adequate for the task. </li>
  <li><a
    href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.16/binutils/dlltool.html">dlltool</a>
    and <a href="http://olex.openlogic.com/packages/mingw-utils">reimp</a> (if
    building on Windows). Sometimes you must acquire one or both of these tools
    separately from the MinGW bundle. </li>
</ol>

<p>After unpacking and installing the prerequisites, you must configure Qt
before you may compile it. Open a command prompt (xterm or similar on Linux,
cmd.exe on Windows), navigate to the directory where you extracted the source
code, and run one of the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On Linux: <span class="console">./configure -opensource -platform
    linux-g++ -release -qt-sql-mysql -qt-sql-sqlite -I /usr/include/mysql -L
    /usr/lib/mysql</span></li>
  <li>On Windows: <span class="console">configure.exe -opensource -platform
    win32-g++ -release -qt-sql-mysql -qt-sql-sqlite -l mysql -I
    C:\MySQL\include -L C:\MySQL\lib</span></li>
</ul>

<p>In the above commands, <span class="arg">-I</span> refers to location of the
MySQL includes ( *.h header files) while <span class="arg">-L</span> refers to
the location of the MySQL libraries. You <em>must</em> change the values
assigned to the <span class="arg">-I</span> and <span class="arg">-L</span>
arguments (if necessary) to reflect the actual paths to these objects on your
system.</p>

<p>Once configuration is finished, the configure script instructs you to begin
the compile procedure. This is done by running <span
class="console">make</span> (or <span class="console">mingw32-make</span> on
Windows). You should expect the build process to take several hours depending
on your processor speed and the number of cores devoted to the process. Once
the build is finished, you must install Qt by running <span
class="console">make install</span> or <span class="console">mingw32-make
install</span>, after which the new environment is ready to be used.</p>

<p>Although RoboJournal will work if you compile the MySQL/SQLite driver as a
plugin, you should compile the drivers into the main Qt SQL module for best
results (i.e use <span class="arg">-qt-sql-mysql</span> instead of <span
class="arg">–qt-plugin-mysql</span> during the Qt configuration process).
That way, you are much less likely to run into any unexpected problems caused
by Qt not being able to find the MySQL/SQLite plugins at runtime. RoboJournal
will not be able to make any database connections if it was built using a
flawed Qt where the drivers were compiled improperly, failed to compile, or are
otherwise missing.</p>

<p>The RoboJournal build procedure requires the Qt Assistant and
QCollectionGenerator programs to be installed where the compiler can locate and
properly utilize them (these programs are acquired by installing the
"qt4-dev-tools" package). QCollectionGenerator is used to compile RoboJournal's
documentation from its base components whereas Qt Assistant is required to
display the resulting documentation output file. </p>

<p>If you decide to custom-build your own Qt, you should use the Qt Assistant
and QCollectionGenerator applications produced through that process instead of
the ones from the "qt4-dev-tools" package. In all instances, the RoboJournal
build procedure expects to find QCollectionGenerator at
/usr/bin/qcollectiongenerator and Qt Assistant at /usr/bin/assistant yet a
custom Qt stores these utilities elsewhere. As a consequence, the RoboJournal
build attempt will fail. </p>

<p>The easiest way to solve this problem is through the use of hardlinks
because the RoboJournal build script cannot tell the difference between a
hardlink and an actual program. If your custom Qt is installed elsewhere, you
can use the Unix "ln" (link) utility to create hardlinks to these programs in
the /usr/bin folder. When the build script sends instructions to the
/usr/bin/qcollectiongenerator hardlink, the instructions are then forwarded to
that program's true location instead (causing everything to work properly).
Invoking the "ln" utility requires root or superuser (sudo) permissions because
the command affects the contents of the system-level /usr/bin folder.</p>

<p>This procedure may be done through the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Qt Assistant: <span class="arg">sudo ln [absolute path to your assistant
    executable] [target destination]</span>; for instance, <span
    class="console">sudo ln /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.4/bin/assistant
    /usr/bin/assistant</span></li>
  <li>QCollectionGenerator: <span class="arg">sudo ln [absolute path to your
    qcollectiongenerator executable] [target destination]</span>; for instance,
    <span class="console">sudo ln
    /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.4/bin/qcollectiongenerator
    /usr/bin/collectiongenerator</span></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reprocess">Preparing the MySQL Libraries for Windows</h3>

<p>MySQL header files are compatible with any operating system and require no
changes. While the "raw" Windows MySQL development library file (libmysql.lib)
may be used as-is by the Linux compiler, it is unusable on Windows unless you
alter it with the dlltool and reimp utilities prior to the compile process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a cmd.exe terminal and set its PATH to the directory that contains
    reimp and dlltool.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the directory that contains libmysql.lib. For this example,
    assume that file is located in the path given in the <span
    class="arg">-L</span> argument of the configure statement (i.e.
    C:\MySQL\lib).</li>
  <li>Run reimp on the library: <span class="console">reimp -d
    libmysql.lib</span>. A file called libmysql.def is produced through this
    step.</li>
  <li>Use dlltool on libmysql.def: <span class="console">dlltool --input -def
    libmysql.def --dllname libmysql.dll --output-lib libmysql.a -k</span>.</li>
  <li>Dlltool produces a file called libmysql.a, which is essentially the
    "fixed" version of the MySQL development library. Once you have this file,
    you are ready to build Qt.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="build">  Building RoboJournal From Source</h2>

<p>The procedure for building RoboJournal varies widely depending on operating
system. The process consists of generating a Makefile, compiling the source
against the Qt libraries according to the Makefile instructions, and
(optionally) installing the resulting executable file.</p>

<p>A Makefile consists of the necessary instructions required to build a
program for a given operating system. Makefiles are operating system specific;
a Makefile generated on a Linux system will not build a valid Windows
executable or vice versa.  RoboJournal’s Makefiles are generated by a
program called QMake, which is part of the Qt development environment you
should have at this point.<br />
</p>

<div class="FYI">
<p><strong>FYI:</strong> The RoboJournal source package (version 0.3 and newer)
includes a build helper script that automates the compile procedure on Windows
(2000, XP, Vista, and 7) machines. Open win32_compile.bat in a text editor and
make all necessary path changes (specify the locations of Qt and MinGW on your
system but do not change anything else). After that, run win32_compile.bat to
compile RoboJournal in one easy step.</p>

<p>The build helper script builds robojournal.exe inside a separate "release"
folder in the robojournal-0.4.1 directory. After the helper script is finished,
you must locate the required <a href="#depends">dependency</a> files if
necessary.</p>

<p>You may run the win32_cleanup.bat file to completely clean the
robojournal-0.4.1 folder between builds.</p>
</div>

<div class="FYI">
<p><strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal 0.4.1 introduces a similar build script
for Unix/Linux. It is stored as a Perl-based script in the RoboJournal source
directory. Since practically every Linux system includes Perl support out of
the box, the script works without requiring anything extra (beyond the base
RoboJournal build requirements for your specific distribution). This script
greatly simplifies the process of compiling and installing RoboJournal on any
type of Linux. </p>

<p>To run this script, open a terminal, navigate to the RoboJournal source
directory, and run <span class="console">./linux_compile.pl</span>.</p>
</div>
<hr />

<h3 id="windows">Manual Windows Procedure</h3>

<p>This procedure should work for any NT-based Windows since Windows 2000. If
you wish to compile RoboJournal manually instead of using the build helper
script, follow the procedure below. For the sake of simplicity in this
procedure, assume Qt is located in C:\Qt, MinGW is located in C:\MinGW, and
RoboJournal's source code is located in C:\robojournal-0.4.1. In a real-world
situation, these locations vary depending on where you installed everything.
You will receive errors if you fail to revise the paths to match your actual
configuration.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the Start Menu » All Programs » Accessories » Command Prompt. A
    cmd.exe window is displayed. From this point on, all input should be
    directed to the cmd.exe window unless otherwise indicated.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the RoboJournal source folder.  Type <span
    class="console">cd C:\robojournal-0.4.1</span> and press Enter.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">path C:\Qt\bin</span> and press Enter. This
    changes the current path for cmd.exe and allows you to run any program from
    C:\Qt\bin even though you should still be in the C:\robojournal-0.4.1
    directory.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">qmake –config release robojournal.pro</span>
    and press Enter. QMake will create a Makefile in the C:\robojournal-0.4.1
    directory.</li>
  <li>When QMake is finished, type <span class="console">dir</span> (and press
    Enter) to display the file list.</li>
  <li>If there is a Makefile in the file list (look for a file called
    "Makefile"), type <span class="console">path C:\MinGW\bin</span> and press
    Enter.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">mingw32-make</span> at the command prompt and
    press Enter. You may accelerate the compile process by running <span
    class="console">mingw32-make -j 2</span> instead. This instructs the
    compiler to process two jobs at once, thereby cutting the build time in
    half. However, running more than three jobs simultaneously rarely yields
    additional speed benefits and may cause problems.</li>
  <li>Wait for mingw32-make to finish (the build is done when text stops
    auto-scrolling and the terminal accepts input again).</li>
  <li>At this point, you should have a robojournal.exe file in the
    C:\robojournal-0.4.1 (or C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release) directory.</li>
  <li>Resolve dependencies if necessary (refer to the <a
    href="#depends">section</a> below). </li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">robojournal.exe</span> and press Enter to
    start the program for the first time. You may also start the program by
    opening Windows Explorer, navigating to the C:\robojournal-0.4.1 (or
    C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release) folder, and double-clicking the
    robojournal.exe program icon.</li>

<h3 id="depends">Resolving Windows Dependencies</h3>

<p>The robojournal.exe produced by the compile procedure works by itself if the
Qt you compiled against is static-built. A static-built Qt environment embeds
all required dependencies into the output executable file itself, the only
drawback being a much larger file size for the executable. Static-built
binaries have the advantage of being highly portable but their large size can
occasionally be a problem.</p>

<p>If your Qt is <em>not</em> static, locate the following files on your hard
drive (they <em>must</em> be from the same Qt and MinGW libraries you compiled
against) and copy them to the C:\robojournal-0.4.1 (or
C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release) folder. The following list displays the required
files and where they are most likely to be located:</p>
<ul>
  <li>libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll (MinGW bin folder)</li>
  <li>libmysql.dll (MySQL lib folder)</li>
  <li>libstdc++-6.dll (MinGW bin folder)</li>
  <li>QtCore4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
  <li>QtGui4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
  <li>QtSql4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
  <li>QtNetwork4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
  <li>QtWebKit4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
  <li>assistant.exe (Qt bin folder) 
    <ul>
      <li>QtCLucene4.dll (Qt 4.x bin folder)</li>
      <li>QtHelp4.dll (Qt 4.x lib folder)</li>
      <li>qsqllite4.dll (Qt 4.x plugins/sqldrivers folder)*</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>robojournal.qch (should already exist in the C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release
    folder after the build process)</li>
  <li>robojournal.qhc (should already exist in the C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release
    folder after the build process)</li>
</ul>

<p><small>* Place this file in C:\robojournal-0.4.1\release\sqldrivers (create
the "sqldrivers" folder if it does not exist).</small></p>
<hr />

<h3 id="debian_requirements">Debian, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint Requirements</h3>

<p>Users of Debian-family distros (including Debian itself, Ubuntu, Linux Mint,
et al.) must install the the following packages through apt-get: </p>
<ul>
  <li>libqt4-core</li>
  <li>libqt4-gui</li>
  <li>libqt4-network</li>
  <li>libqt4-webkit</li>
  <li>libqt4-sql</li>
  <li>libqt4-sql-mysql</li>
  <li>libqt4-sql-sqlite</li>
  <li>libqt4-help</li>
  <li>qt4-dev-tools</li>
  <li>qt4-qmake</li>
  <li>libx11-dev</li>
  <li>build-essential (if it is not already installed)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install all of these packages simultaneously by running <span
class="console">sudo apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-network
libqt4-webkit libqt4-sql libqt4-sql-mysql libqt4-sql-sqlite libqt4-help
qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake libx11-dev build-essential</span>. Ensure that the
entire command consists of one unbroken line before you copy and paste it into
the terminal.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="fedora_requirements">Fedora Requirements</h3>

<p>The Qt environment on Fedora is unusual because certain utilities have
slightly different names: Qmake is called "qmake-qt4" while Qt Assistant is
called "assistant-qt4". Be sure to take these name changes into consideration
in order to prevent problems during the build process. </p>

<p>All requirements are applicable to Fedora 18 and later (older versions are
unsupported). Building RoboJournal from source requires you to install the
following packages through the yum package management system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>qt</li>
  <li>qt-assistant</li>
  <li>qt-mysql</li>
  <li>qt-devel</li>
  <li>qt-webkit</li>
  <li>qt-webkit-devel</li>
  <li>patch</li>
  <li>gcc-c++ *</li>
</ul>

<p><small>* Due to a dependency conflict, you may need to manually update the
audit package (audit-2.2.1-2 on Fedora 18) before you can install
gcc-c++.</small></p>

<p>You can install all these packages at once by running <span
class="console">sudo yum install qt qt-assistant qt-mysql qt-devel qt-webkit
qt-webkit-devel patch gcc-c++</span>. Ensure that the entire command consists
of one unbroken line before you copy and paste it into the terminal.</p>

<p>In addition to resolving the basic package requirements, you must also patch
the Makefile (once you have created one with qmake-qt4) because Fedora requires
direct linking to the X11 libraries. You must apply the fedora_build.patch file
to the Makefile by running <span class="console">patch Makefile &lt;
fedora_build.patch</span> prior to running make. Alternatively, the Linux build
helper script can automatically apply the patch for you if you instruct it to
do so during the question-and-answer configuration steps. Forgetting to patch
the Makefile causes the build process to fail even if the other requirements
have been satisfied.</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="linux">Manual Linux Procedure</h3>

<p>The build process for Linux is much more straightforward. Unlike most source
packages, there is no configure script that must be used prior to the compile
process (QMake handles this role instead). Assume that all utilities are stored
in /usr/bin and can therefore be invoked without specifying an absolute path.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal application (xterm or similar). There is no specific
    shell requirement; most systems use Bash by default. From this point on,
    all input should be directed to the terminal unless otherwise
  indicated.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">cd ~/robojoural-0.4.1</span> and press
  Enter.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">qmake robojournal.pro</span> and press Enter
    (substitute "qmake" with "qmake-qt4" on Fedora). 

    <div class="FYI">
    <strong>FYI:</strong> If you need to create a package build for Debian, you
    should substitute the regular Qmake command with <span
    class="console">qmake CONFIG+=package robojournal.pro</span> (change the
    path to Qmake if necessary). You should not create a package build
    <em>unless</em> you are a Debian maintainer and you need to package
    RoboJournal for inclusion in the repositories. </div>
  </li>
  <li>Wait for the QMake process to finish. If you are using Fedora, apply the
    patch to the Makefile once Qmake has finished: <span class="console">patch
    Makefile &lt; fedora_build.patch</span>.</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">make</span> and press Enter. You may
    accelerate the compile process by running <span class="console">make -j
    2</span> instead. This instructs the compiler to process two jobs at once,
    thereby cutting the build time in half. However, running more than three
    jobs simultaneously rarely yields additional speed benefits and may cause
    problems.</li>
  <li>Wait for the compiler to finish (the build is done when text stops
    auto-scrolling and the terminal accepts input again).</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">./robojournal</span> and press Enter to start
    the program for the first time. You may also start the program by opening a
    graphical file manager like Nautilus or Dolphin, navigating to the
    ~/robojournal-0.4.1 folder, and clicking the "robojournal" file. 
    <p>The build process is complete after Step 7. The next three steps are
    completely optional and deal with system-wide installation. Properly
    installing RoboJournal makes it available to all users whereas running it
    out of the build directory limits its availability to your own user
    account. /usr/local/bin is the default install location for all software
    programs that have been compiled from source, including RoboJournal. Under
    no circumstances should the RoboJournal executable be placed in /usr/bin
    (unless you are creating a package build for Debian). The following steps
    require root or superuser permissions to complete:</p>
  </li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">su</span> and press Enter to switch to root.
    If the root account is not configured (as is typical on Ubuntu and its
    derivitives), you can temporarily gain root-level permissions by preceding
    commands with "sudo".</li>
  <li>Type <span class="console">make install</span> (or <span
    class="console">sudo make install</span>) and press Enter.</li>
  <li>Debian (and related systems) only: Type <span
    class="console">update-menus</span> and press Enter to add RoboJournal to
    the Debian Applications menu. A menu entry is added automatically during
    the "make install" step if you are using KDE or Gnome, but other window
    managers often require a manual refresh before new menu items are
  displayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>RoboJournal is now installed for all users. For convenience, the install
process places a launcher for RoboJournal in the Office sub-group of your
Applications list. This launcher is available to all users and points to the
installed copy of RoboJournal (not the one in the ~/robojournal-0.4.1 build
folder). The installed copy is henceforth referred to as the "global copy" in
this documentation. You can also launch the global copy of RoboJournal by
entering <span class="console">robojournal</span> at any command prompt (do not
precede the command with ./).</p>

<p>To uninstall, navigate to the ~/robojournal-0.4.1 directory, switch to root
(or use sudo), type <span class="console">make uninstall</span>, and press
Enter. This completely removes the global copy and any shortcuts that point to
it. You should always uninstall prior to upgrading to a newer version of
RoboJournal; do not install a new global copy over an existing one. If you wish
to clean up the object code (*.o files) left behind by the compiler, type <span
class="console">make clean</span> (and press Enter) in the build folder. This
action cleans the ~/robojournal-0.4.1 folder but spares the Makefile and the
executable made during the most recent build.</p>

<p>Type <span class="console">make distclean</span> (and press Enter) if you
wish to <em>completely</em> purge the build folder of all compiled objects,
including the Makefile and executable. You <em>must</em> run a distclean
between every build.</p>
