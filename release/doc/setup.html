      <h2 id="overview">Overview and System Requirements</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal was originally designed to run on x86 or AMD64
      CPU architectures. Since RoboJournal's source code is
      publicly available under the GPL3, RoboJournal can be ported
      to less common system architectures (assuming that a full Qt
      environment and all necessary database applications are
      available for that platform). For instance, RoboJournal is
      compatible with Debian Linux systems running on MIPS, ARM,
      and POWERPC CPU architectures.</p>

      <p>RoboJournal's system requirements are quite modest by
      modern standards since the program runs with ease even on
      very low-end computers. The following list addresses the
      <em>bare minimum</em> system requirements for the program to
      work effectively at all:</p>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>A client computer with the following hardware and
        software specifications<sup>*</sup>:

          <ul>
            <li>Windows 2000 (or later) or Linux (kernel 2.6 or
            later).</li>

            <li>Pentium II or better (for 32-bit/x86). Any 64-bit
            CPU is likely adequate for custom AMD64 builds.</li>

            <li>Video display capable of achieving at least
            1024x768 screen resolution. RoboJournal can run on
            800x600 screen resolution (or below) but some parts of
            the interface may not completely fit on the screen even
            while maximized.</li>

            <li>64 MB of RAM (on Windows).</li>

            <li>58 MiB of hard disk space (on Windows). The Windows
            version of RoboJournal has a much larger installation
            footprint because it includes its own set of Qt
            libraries. Linux disk space requirements only include
            the RoboJournal executable itself (2-3 MiB) since Qt
            libraries on the system tend to be shared amongst all
            Qt apps and not just RoboJournal.</li>

            <li>Wired ethernet or 802.11a/b/g/n wireless network
            connectivity to interact with
            host/server<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Linux-based client
            machines require Internet connectivity in order to
            retrieve the necessary Qt packages.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>A server (host) machine with the following
        specifications<sup>&dagger;</sup>:

          <ul>
            <li>MySQL server instance (and root-level access
            permissions).</li>

            <li>Adequate bandwidth, memory, and processor speed to
            accommodate all database transactions. The specific
            requirements vary depending on your situation and the
            average system load on the machine in question.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> Compiling RoboJournal from source
        code may require up to 400 MiB of free hard drive space.
        The compiler uses this allocation as temporary scratch
        space; all affected resources are freed for other use
        immediately after the build process has finished. Be
        advised that RoboJournal may not compile correctly if your
        hard drive does not have enough free space available during
        build time.
      </div>

      <p class="footnote">* Requirements do not take operating
      system/other software requirements into consideration. The
      actual requirements are the cumulative requirements of the
      entire software stack on the machine in question.<br>
      <br>
      &dagger; A remote server/host machine and the hardware
      necessary to connect to it are only necessary if your journal
      database is not stored locally. In this case, "locally" is
      defined as being the same machine on which RoboJournal is
      installed. The server requirements should be added to the
      base client system requirements if you <em>are</em> storing
      your database locally.</p>

      <h2 id="install_mysql">Installing MySQL</h2>

      <p>RoboJournal requires a working MySQL server in order to
      use MySQL-based journals. This server process can run on the
      same computer as RoboJournal (i.e. localhost) or be deployed
      on a machine located on your LAN/WAN or on the Internet. The
      installation process creates a working MySQL server instance
      on the computer you have selected. Once installation is
      complete, the affected computer is able to receive and
      negotiate MySQL connections from itself and from other
      machines that have the correct access permissions.</p>

      <p>You should consider installing <a href=
      "http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">MySQL
      Workbench</a> after you have installed MySQL Server. MySQL
      Workbench is a replacement for the older MySQL Administrator
      tool (which provided a similar function). Although it is not
      required for MySQL Server to function, MySQL Workbench
      provides a visual environment to simplify interaction with
      your journals and other databases. As such, MySQL Workbench
      is ideal for users who are at the beginner-to-intermediate
      level of MySQL proficiency.</p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> RoboJournal fully supports <a href=
        "https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a> (a compatible drop-in
        replacement for MySQL's database engine) in versions 0.5
        and later.
      </div>

      <h3 id="mysql_windows">Windows Procedure</h3>

      <p>The Windows installation procedure for MySQL is very
      straightforward. You should begin by downloading the latest
      MSI installer package for Windows from the <a href=
      "http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">MySQL website</a>. The free
      MySQL Community Edition is adequate for RoboJournal's
      requirements but you can also use the non-free Enterprise
      Version if you have a license for it. This guide uses version
      5.6.10.1 but the procedure is probably applicable (unless
      otherwise noted) to newer versions as well. Once you have the
      installation file (in this case,
      mysql-installer-community-5.6.10.1.msi), double-click its
      icon to begin the installation process:</p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> The MySQL installer depends on the
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net">.NET Framework</a>
        &ge; 4.0. You must satisfy this dependency by installing
        .NET (if you have not already done so) before you can
        install MySQL. You also need the <a href=
        "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555">
        Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 32-bit Runtime</a> if you intend
        to install MySQL WorkBench.
      </div>

      <ol class="list">
        <li>Windows Vista and later may request confirmation when
        you double-click the installer executable. It is safe to
        proceed if the publisher is listed as "Oracle America,
        Inc." If that is the case, click the <strong>Run</strong>
        button to continue. You may need to provide confirmation
        twice. Once Windows has finished configuring the installer,
        the MySQL Installer Welcome window is displayed:<img alt=
        "Figure 1" src="img/screens/mysql_install1.png" width="795"
        height="593" class="screenshot"><span class=
        "caption">Figure 1: MySQL installer main menu.</span></li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Install MySQL Products</strong>
        option. The License Agreement window is displayed:<img alt=
        "Figure 2" src="img/screens/mysql_install2.png" width="795"
        height="593" class="screenshot"><span class=
        "caption">Figure 2: MySQL Community Edition is available
        under the GPLv2.</span></li>

        <li>Once you have read the license terms, check the
        <strong>I accept these license terms</strong> box. Click
        the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue.</li>

        <li>The installer will check to see if any upgrades are
        possible at the current time. Click the
        <strong>Execute</strong> button. Once the check is
        finished, click the <strong>Next</strong> button to
        continue.</li>

        <li>The Choosing a Setup Type window is
          displayed:<img alt="Figure 3" src=

          class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 3: The
          option you choose determines which features are
          installed.</span> Select the option that is the best fit
          for your situation and click <strong>Next</strong> to
          continue:

          <ul>
            <li>Most users should select the <strong>Server
            Only</strong> option.</li>

            <li>Select the <strong>Full</strong> option if you want
            to install everything. This option requires Microsoft
            Excel 2007 (or newer) in addition to the Visual C++
            Runtime needed to run MySQL Workbench.</li>

            <li>Select the <strong>Custom</strong> option to
            manually pick and choose which components should be
            installed (recommended if you only want MySQL Server
            and MySQL Workbench).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>The Check Requirements window informs you of any
        additional components that need to be installed. Click
        <strong>Next</strong> if you already have everything you
        need. You <em>must</em> install all required missing
        components before the installer will allow you to continue.
        When you get to the Installation Progress window, click the
        <strong>Execute</strong> button to begin the
        installation:<img alt="Figure 4" src=
        "img/screens/mysql_install4.png" width="795" height="593"
        class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 4: MySQL
        installation in progress.</span></li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button <em>twice</em>
        after the installation is finished to begin configuration.
        The MySQL Server Configuration (1 of 3) window is
        displayed:<span class="caption"><img alt="Figure 5" src=

        (except the <strong>Config Type</strong> field) unless
        absolutely necessary.</span></li>

        <li>Change the <strong>Config Type:</strong> drop-down list
        item to "Server Machine". Click <strong>Next</strong> to
        continue (do not change any other values or enable
        <strong>Show Advanced Options</strong> unless you have good
        reason to make changes and you know what you are
        doing).</li>

        <li>The MySQL Server Configuration (2 of 3) window is
        displayed: <img alt="Figure 6" src=
        "img/screens/mysql_install7.png" width="795" height="593"
        class="screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 6: The
        <strong>Next</strong> button is unlocked once the two
        fields that set the root password match.</span></li>

        <li>Enter a password for the root account in the
        <strong>MySQL Root Password:</strong> and <strong>Repeat
        Password:</strong> fields. The root password should be
        strong (i.e. not easily guessed). A strong password
        generally consists of a randomized &acirc;&permil;&yen;
        9-character series of numbers, upper/lowercase characters,
        and typographical symbols typically found on a keyboard.
        This password is <em>extremely</em> important so either
        memorize it or store it in a very safe place for future
        reference. RoboJournal asks for the root password whenever
        you create a new journal.

          <div class="FYI">
            <strong>FYI:</strong> Do not create any other user
            accounts at this time unless you already have a journal
            you wish to import. In that case, go ahead and create
            the account that the imported journal is to be
            associated with.
          </div>
        </li>

        <li>Click the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue. The
        MySQL Server Configuration (3 of 3) window is displayed. Do
        <em>not</em> change any of the values on this window unless
        you know exactly what you are doing and have a legitimate
        reason to make changes. Click <strong>Next</strong> to
        continue.<img alt="Figure 7" src=

        <li>MySQL will be automatically configured according to the
        parameters you provided. When the process is complete,
        click the <strong>Finish</strong> button to exit the MySQL
        installer.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>MySQL is now installed and properly configured for your
      Windows system. You can now proceed with the RoboJournal
      installation process.</p>

      <h3 id="mysql_linux">Linux Procedure</h3>

      <p>Unlike Windows, most software on Linux-based systems comes
      from centralized repositories managed by the various
      distributions. It is not unusual for several distributions to
      share the same repositories. If you are using a common
      distribution like Ubuntu or Fedora, MySQL can be
      automatically installed and configured by your package
      management system. Since this process is often handled
      entirely behind the scenes, there is no step-by-step
      graphical installer application.</p>

      <p>The following table gives the commands required to install
      a MySQL server on the most common types of Linux. The various
      distributions are grouped into families; Ubuntu (and all its
      variants) is in the Debian family while Fedora is in the Red
      Hat family. In all instances, open a terminal window (bash
      shell or similar) and type the appropriate command for your
      operating system as root or a superuser:</p>

      <table border="0">
        <col>
        <col>

        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td class="left">Debian Family &mdash; Debian, Ubuntu
            (all variants), Linux Mint, etc.</td>

            <td class="right">Install the "mysql-server" package
            with apt-get: <span class="console">sudo apt-get
            install mysql-server</span>. You are prompted to set
            the MySQL root password during the setup process so you
            should have the password you intend to use ready in
            advance. MySQL is ready for use immediately after the
            installation process is finished.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td class="left">Red Hat Family&mdash; Fedora,
            CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise</td>

            <td class="right">Install the "mysql-server" package

            "console">sudo mysql_secure_installation</span> because
            MySQL has little to no security immediately after
            installation. Finally, you must instruct MySQL to start
            automatically at every boot by running <span class=
            "console">sudo systemctl enable mysqld.service
            &amp;&amp; systemctl start mysqld.service</span>. MySQL
            is available for use once you have finished the last

      <h2 id="install_robojournal">Installing RoboJournal</h2>

      <p>As a cross-platform application, RoboJournal is designed
      to be easy to install on a variety of operating systems. As
      such, RoboJournal can be installed on Windows 2000 and later
      through a traditional installer. RoboJournal binaries are
      also available in package format that can be installed on
      Linux-based systems through native package management
      tools.</p>

      <h3 id="install_windows">Windows Procedure</h3>

      <p>An installer package for the latest version of RoboJournal
      is always available for the Windows platform. The RoboJournal
      installation package takes the form of a traditional Windows
      installer application that can be acquired directly from
      SourceForge or from one of the other software download sites
      on which it is mirrored. Each version of the RoboJournal
      installer package uses a distinctive naming convention (i.e.
      robojournal-[$version]-setup.exe) in order to help you
      differentiate it from any other installer packages that are
      likely to be found in your user account's Downloads
      folder.</p>

      <div class="FYI">
        <strong>FYI:</strong> You should uninstall any old version
        of RoboJournal on your computer before installing the
        latest version.
      </div>

      <p>Once you have downloaded the installer executable,
      double-click its icon to start the installation process.
      Windows Vista and later may require you to provide UAC
      authorization before setup is allowed to continue. The Setup
      Wizard is displayed after you have given the necessary
      permissions: <img alt="Figure 8" src=
      "img/screens/win_setup1.png" width="513" height="398" class=
      "screenshot"><span class="caption">Figure 8: The Windows
      installer walks you through the entire setup process. The
      tool looks and acts the same for all versions of
      RoboJournal.</span></p>

      <p>You must complete all the steps in the installer to
      successfully install RoboJournal. The installer is very easy
      to use and provides its own instructions during each step of
      the procedure.</p>

      <p>All official RoboJournal releases on the Windows platform
      are 32-bit. The 32-bit version is fully functional on both
      the x86 and x86-64 CPU architectures that nearly every
      version of Windows run on. However, you must build
      RoboJournal from source in order to get a true 64-bit
      version. Instructions for producing a 32-bit custom build are
      found in the "RoboJournal Compile and Installation Guide"
      (stored as "compile-instructions.xhtml" in the RoboJournal
      source package). Although the basic compile procedure is the
      same, you need 64-bit Qt libraries, 64-bit MySQL libraries,
      and a 64-bit compiler toolchain to produce a 64-bit version
      of RoboJournal.</p>

      <h3 id="install_linux">Linux Procedure</h3>

      <p>Currently, an old pre-packaged version of RoboJournal
      (0.2.1 as of March 2013) is available in the Debian
      repositories (which are shared with Ubuntu and Linux Mint).
      These repositories contain multiple variants of the package
      that are suited for different system architectures (x86,
      x86-64, ARM, etc.). This package can be installed by running,
      <span class="console">apt-get install robojournal</span> as
      root or superuser. The version in the Debian repositories is
      out of date because the Debian package upgrade cycle is much
      slower than RoboJournal's development process has been so
      far.</p>

      <p>The only way to get the absolute latest version of
      RoboJournal on Linux is to build it from source. This is not
      difficult as it sounds because all you need are the Qt
      libraries that the old version of RoboJournal installs anyway
      in addition to the base Linux compiler toolkit. For more
      information on the compile process (including step-by-step
      instructions), please refer to the "RoboJournal Compile and
      Installation Guide" (stored as "compile-instructions.xhtml"
      in the RoboJournal source package).</p>
