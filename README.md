							OVERVIEW
####################################################################

This archive contains the complete source code for RoboJournal 0.5 
(currently the "experimental" version). As such, the code is nominally 
functional but some parts are still incomplete and may not work correctly. 

RoboJournal is a cross-platform journal/diary tool written in Qt/C++.
It works in conjunction with MySQL to allow the user to create
journal databases locally or on a remote server. RoboJournal emphasizes
streamlined, practical design plus ease-of-use.

RoboJournal runs on Windows and Linux.
