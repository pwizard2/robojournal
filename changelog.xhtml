<h1>RoboJournal ChangeLog</h1>

<div class="even">
<h2>Version 0.5</h2>

<p>Release Date: TBA</p>

<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Vastly improved the Editor window: 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> tagging support to the Editor. This
        allows you to write or modify an entry and apply tags to it using the
        same interface.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> rich text formatting
      capabilities.</li>
      <li>Moved the <strong>Save this Entry</strong> and <strong>Discard
        Entry</strong> buttons to the upper toolbar to make more room for the
        new formatting buttons on the lower toolbar.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> SQLite database support.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> new Journal Creator. The new class is
    very similar to the Newconfig class added in version 0.4; the new class is
    designed to be highly modular with support for several different databases.
    Each database is represented by a "page". 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated</span> old Journal Creator class
        and removed its files (journalcreator.cpp, journalcreator.h, and
        journalcreator.ui) from the codebase since they are no longer
      needed.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> SQLite page to the Journal
      Creator.</li>
      <li>Converted existing MySQL settings into a page for the new Journal
        Creator.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> password strength meter to MySQL
        page.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Fixed "ugly 16x16 icon" bug on
    Windows 7. This bug caused an overstretched icon to be used on the ALT+TAB
    window list and similar places.</li>
  <li>Improved the layout efficiency on the Mainwindow by removing unneeded
    padding space around various objects.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> old-school raised splitter bars to the
    Mainwindow and Editor classes to make the splitters easier to see. This was
    necessary because Windows tends to render splitters as flat and they
    blended into the layout too much.</li>
  <li>Gave the original tag manager window (Tagger class) a complete overhaul
    to make it resemble the Editor's built-in tag interface in order to improve
    consistency.</li>
  <li>Consolidated many tagging-related functions into their own TaggingShared
    class. This is a better design because common tagging functions are now
    shared; the same code can be used in the various tagging-related functions
    throughout the entire program (thereby eliminating redundancy).</li>
  <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated</span> text labels on toolbar buttons
    and removed that option from the Preferences/General window. This is
    because text labels are no longer practical on the Editor layout with so
    many new buttons (tooltips alone are sufficient for identification
    purposes) and it would be strange to have some of the buttons contain
    labels while others do not. Many buttons (bold, italic, etc.) use universal
    symbols, making labels unnecessary in such cases. </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The vertical splitter bar on the
    Mainwindow now remembers its position between program sessions. The
    splitter only reverts to its default 50/50 position if the saved position
    data is unavailable. 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> an option to restore the default
        splitter position to the Mainwindow/Window drop-down menu. This option
        overrides the current saved position.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Updated the Journal Selector window with new features:
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> the Assign Permissions extension to
        the Journal Selector to simplify the creation of user accounts and the
        association of user accounts with journal databases. </li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> a <strong>Browse</strong> button to
        allow the user to select a SQLite database from disk.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Tightened up the user interface by removing extra window padding on Tagger, NewConfig, EntryExporter, and JournalSelector classes.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="odd">
<h2>Version 0.4.1</h2>

<p>Release Date: 4/5/13</p>

<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Windows version of RoboJournal is now compiled against Qt 4.8.4
    instead of Qt 4.7.4 (which was used in versions 0.1–0.4). As such, most
    of the dynamic link libraries (DLL files) shipped with the Windows version
    of RoboJournal are brand-new.The purpose of the Qt version increment is to
    keep pace with the version of Qt in the Debian repositories.</li>
  <li>The current version number is no longer listed in the title bar on
    RoboJournal's main window. </li>
  <li>The tooltip for the <strong>Entries</strong> tab on the main window now
    reads, "Display the Chronological Entry List" in accordance with the
    official name of the object in the new documentation.</li>
  <li>Changed the icon for the <strong>Clear</strong> button on the Appearance
    Page in RoboJournal Preferences.</li>
  <li>Changed the layout of the About RoboJournal dialog.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The <strong>Font Color</strong> field
    on the Appearance Page in RoboJournal Preferences no longer accepts direct
    input (necessary to prevent the user from entering an invalid color
  value).</li>
  <li>Renamed the <strong>Select default Journal</strong> drop-down menu entry
    to <strong>Journal Selector</strong>. 
    <ol>
      <li>Changed the Select default journal window title to "Journal
      Selector".</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Corrected spacing issue affecting
    Linux Mint (and other distros with larger-than-average text) in the Welcome
    to RoboJournal window displayed during First-Run. </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The current search term now requires
    the Enter key to be pressed only once in order to run a search; in 0.4 the
    user had to press the key twice to trigger the <strong>Search</strong>
    button.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The data from the most recent search
    is now automatically cleared whenever you change the search type (any type
    of pattern match to tag search and vice versa).</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Clicking the Search for whole words
    button now causes focus to return to the search term box automatically
    (thereby saving the user an extra click).</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> "Speech Balloon" icon option to entry
    node choices.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> ALT key shortcut combos to all boolean
    (selectable/unselectable) options in RoboJournal Preferences. The
    underlined letter in the item description indicates which key is required
    to trigger the option (i.e. "<span
    style="text-decoration: underline">O</span>ption 1" would be triggered by
    ALT+O).</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> Tag Reminder system. This feature
    displays a window that notifies you of any untagged entries in your journal
    each time you log in. The Tag Reminder is designed to get the users into
    the habit of tagging their entries. 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> option to enable/disable the Tag
        Reminder window to the "General" Page in RoboJournal Preferences. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Eliminated the possibility of the
    user declaring a "null" tag by using a more sophisticated Regular
    Expression to detect attempts instead of relying on a simple ==
  operator.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> new feature that allows the name of the
    current journal to be displayed in the main window title bar. 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> an option to enable/disable this
        behavior to the "General" Page in RoboJournal Preferences. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Disconnecting while there are search
    results present on the <strong>Search</strong> tab no longer crashes the
    program.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> comprehensive documentation for
    RoboJournal 0.4.1 (displayed with the included Qt Assistant program).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Post-Release Updates</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Split documentation into a separate <em>robojournal-doc</em> package on
    Debian-based Linux (including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, <em>et al</em>) because
    including documentation in each architecture-specific package is redundant
    when the documentation itself is platform-agnostic.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> packaging support for Fedora Linux 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> patch to make the build process
        compatible with Fedora direct-linking requirements.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> an option for the Fedora patch to
        the Linux build script (linux_compile.pl).</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> a <em>pkg</em> folder in the source
        tree for the Fedora SPEC files.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="even">
<h2>Version 0.4</h2>

<p>Release Date: 12/17/12</p>

<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The background image settings are now
    properly disabled when the user enables the custom style setting. These
    settings only become active if the user selects a background image.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The <b>Use default host and port</b>
    checkbox on the Journal Selector window now obeys the current default
    values setting in the configuration (with one exception: it is always
    enabled during first-run configuration).</li>
  <li>Improved Entry Exporter to allow the user to specify his or her choice in
    font/font size for headers and body text in exported HTML documents. This
    feature is configured through the new <b>Export Settings</b> page in the
    Preferences window.</li>
  <li>Modified date settings to allow the user to show the day of week when an
    entry was made.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> batch file to simplify the
    removal/cleanup of compiled executables, object code, and
    compiler-generated headers between builds. FYI: This tool is only available
    in the source package because its purpose is to revert the source directory
    to its original state after a compile operation has taken place.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> the ability to use the same font
    settings in both the Editor and Entry Output pane in the main window. This
    gives the user a better idea of how the finished entry will look once it
    has been saved.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> automated post-processing features to
    Editor: 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> whitespace removal feature which
        cleans unnecessary line breaks and redundant spaces between words from
        the body text.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> HTML-compliant dashes and
        hyphenation; all instances of -- are replaced with — and dashes
        between numbers are properly elongated (i.e. 1–2).</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> smart quotes feature which replaces
        straight (") quotes with curvy (“) quotes. This feature also affects
        apostrophes and other single quotes in words.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> miscellaneous processing features
        which convert sequences of ≥ 3 adjacent periods to the proper
        ellipsis character (…) and formalizes number notation (i.e.
        1<sup>st</sup>, 112<sup>th</sup>).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> resistance to common forms of SQL
    injection attacks. FYI: Although this new feature provides some degree of
    protection, users should <span
    style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> assume they are 100% safe or
    immune to these attacks.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Solved layout issues which sometimes
    caused parts of the user interface to extend beyond the edges of its window
    or container object (due to large font size usage at the operating system
    level). The user interface for each form now properly accommodates all but
    the largest font sizes without issue.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> RoboJournal now requests confirmation
    if the user quits the program while the Search tab is active.</li>
  <li>Added spellcheck functionality (based on Hunspell) to the Editor.
    RoboJournal comes with a standard US English dictionary but other
    dialects/languages are also supported. Other dictionaries must be
    downloaded from third-party sources (compatible dictionaries consist of a
    DIC/AFF file pair).</li>
  <li>Added new icons to the program and changed many existing ones.</li>
  <li>Changed wording on Entry Exporter dialog tabs.</li>
  <li>Resizable windows now remember their previous size and position between
    sessions.</li>
  <li>Converted the Editor into a toolbar-based layout.</li>
  <li>Main Window, Editor and Preferences windows are now resizable and
    remember their sizes between sessions.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> (Ubuntu-specific) The menu bar in the
    Main Window remains attached to the window instead of inheriting the
    standard Unity menu bar behavior.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Icon-only toolbar button setting (if
    enabled) is now preserved after the user manually launches the Journal
    Creator or Journal Selector.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Any active journal connections now
    automatically terminate if the user manually launches the Journal Creator
    or Journal Selector.</li>
  <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span> Newconfig
    class. This is meant to be a full replacement (and an extension) of the
    original Preferences window. The Newconfig class features a highly modular
    design with potential for future expansion. 
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span>
        ConfigurationGeneral, ConfigurationJournal, ConfigurationEditor,
        ConfigurationExport, ConfigurationAppearance, and ConfigurationMySQL
        classes. Each of these is a separate module (represented as a page on
        the Preferences window) which controls specific settings and interacts
        with the Newconfig class.</li>
      <li>Users now have the ability to override the colors of the
        date/timestamp box and tag box when using a custom theme. It is now
        possible to use system colors <em>and</em> a custom theme
        simultaneously if desired. In prior releases, the background of those
        elements were always the same color as the body text; this new function
        is ideal for those who wish to use a custom font but retain the native
        OS background.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> Old Config class
        (config.cpp, config.h, config.ui). Even though the original Preferences
        interface worked fine at first, RoboJournal has grown in size and
        complexity over the last few releases to the point where the old
        interface had become overcrowded and further expansion was
      impractical.</li>
      <li>Removed deprecated Config class files from source package and all
        references to them in the source code.</li>
      <li>Changed <i>Sort by Day</i> option text to <i>Group journal entries by
        day</i>.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> <i>Display full name (instead of
        username)</i> option. This displays the user's full name instead of the
        abbreviated username in the entry header.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> post-processing options to the
        <b>Editor</b> page.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> Export Preview function to the
        <b>Export</b> page.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> Highlighter-related options to the
        <b>Journal</b> page.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Win32 executables generated through the Build Helper Script are now
    properly stripped (MinGW <i>strip</i> utility). Stripping removes unneeded
    data from the executable which improves efficiency and reduces file
  size.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> menu shortcut launcher for Linux systems
    (robojournal.desktop) to source package (launcher will appear in desktop
    environment/window manager apps menu after the user runs "make install").
    This also (hopefully) resolves a bug affecting versions 0.1 - 0.3 where the
    RoboJournal Debian package sometimes fails to create a menu entry after
    installation.</li>
  <li>Changed Journal Creator launcher text in the Main Window to say "Journal
    Creator" instead of "Create a New Journal".</li>
  <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span>
    SettingsManager class: 
    <ol>
      <li>All settings are now handled through SettingsManager class.</li>
      <li>Changed "STAGE 1" startup text to reference the new SettingsManager
        Class.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> Original configuration
        file (<i>$HomePath/.robojournal/robojournal.cfg</i>). Configuration
        settings are now stored in
        <i>$HomePath/.robojournal/robojournal.ini</i> instead.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> ConfigManager class.
        Removed configmanager.cpp and configmanager.h (and all references to
        them in the source code) from the source package.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> shortcut key (Q) to the exit
    confirmation dialog in Main Window.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> gender check during first-run
    configuration which sets a different username avatar icon for female
  users.</li>
  <li>Removed extra space around the edge of the layout in the Main Window.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> search feature to main window: 
    <ol class="letter">
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> tabbed interface to main window
        splitter.</li>
      <li>Placed journal entry tree in the <b>Entries</b> tab.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="odd">
<h2>Version 0.3</h2>

    <ol class="letter">
      <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> System username is now displayed
        on Linux/Unix systems.</li>
      <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> <span class="added">Added</span>
        more padding below the "Passwords [do not] match" text. This keeps the
        text from being too close to the bottom of the frame.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> tooltips to the <b>Journal Name</b>,
        <b>Journal Host</b>, and <b>Username</b> fields.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Simplified and changed text on FirstRun class UI file. This solves a bug
    where the intro paragraph text size changed depending on system font
  size.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> Build Helper Script (for Windows
  only).</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Fixed a bug that prevented the

  <li>Modified DBLogin Class: 
    <ol class="letter">
      <li>Removed root login warning label and replaced it with QMessageBox
        warnings/errors. This helps reduce crowding/sizing problems on
        large-text systems.</li>
      <li>TextBoxes are set to QLineEdit::ReadOnly instead of
        QLineEdit::SetDisabled when UseDefaults==true.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Changed text for error (critical) QMessageBoxes in Editor class.</li>
  <li>Fixed program icon for Linux systems (previous versions used the
    too-small Windows icon that looked bad when stretched).</li>

    entries (or the whole database) to HTML or plain text: 
    <ol class="letter">
