<h1>RoboJournal ChangeLog</h1>
<div class="even">
<h2>Version 0.4.2</h2>
<p>Release Date: 9/13/13</p>
<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Split documentation into a separate <em>robojournal-doc</em>
package on Debian-based Linux (including Ubuntu, Linux Mint, <em>et al</em>)
because including documentation in each architecture-specific package
is redundant when the documentation itself is platform-agnostic.
    <ol>
      <li>Fixed typos and minor corrections to documentation (9/2/13).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> "pkg" folder for Linux package
mangement files.
    <ol>
      <li>Removed Fedora build patch since it is no longer needed
(6/1/13).</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> SPEC file for creating
Fedora ≥18 packages.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> control file and everything
else required to build Debian/Ubuntu packages (9/2/13).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Temporarily disabled spellcheck on Linux-based systems to prevent
a common crashing bug from occurring.</li>
  <li>Removed Fedora patch question/logic from Linux compile script
(6/1/13).</li>
  <li>Removed caps-lock detection code from the DBLogin class (6/1/13).</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Fixed "ugly 16x16 icon" bug
on Windows 7. This bug caused an overstretched icon to be used on the
ALT+TAB window list and similar places. Backported from RoboJournal 0.5
source (9/11/13).</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> RoboJournal no longer
displays redundant error messages if the documentation files are
missing or installed incorrectly (9/11/13).</li>
  <li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span>
Replaced the documentation build script with a far more robust
Perl-based solution. If the documentation fails to build correctly on
the first attempt, the new build script tries several different
executables until it finds one that works. This fix is necessary
because Qmake often tries to use Qt5 tools on systems that have both
Qt4 and Qt5 installed.
  </li>
    <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The vertical splitter bar on
the MainWindow now remembers its position between program sessions. The
splitter only reverts to its default 50/50 position if the saved
position data is unavailable.
  </li>
    <li><span class="added">Added</span> description/explanation of new features to <i>RoboJournal Documentation</i>.
    <ol>
      <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Documentation version numbers are no longer hardcoded in the help project file and collection file.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="odd">
<h2>Version 0.4.1</h2>
<p>Release Date: 4/5/13</p>
<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Windows version of RoboJournal is now compiled against Qt
4.8.4 instead of Qt 4.7.4 (which was used in versions 0.1–0.4). As
such, most of the dynamic link libraries (DLL files) shipped with the
Windows version of RoboJournal are brand-new.The purpose of the Qt
version increment is to keep pace with the version of Qt in the Debian
repositories.</li>
  <li>The current version number is no longer listed in the title bar
on RoboJournal's main window. </li>
  <li>The tooltip for the <strong>Entries</strong> tab on the main
window now reads, "Display the Chronological Entry List" in accordance
with the official name of the object in the new documentation.</li>
  <li>Changed the icon for the <strong>Clear</strong> button on the
Appearance Page in RoboJournal Preferences.</li>
  <li>Changed the layout of the About RoboJournal dialog.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The <strong>Font Color</strong>
field on the Appearance Page in RoboJournal Preferences no longer
accepts direct input (necessary to prevent the user from entering an
invalid color value).</li>
  <li>Renamed the <strong>Select default Journal</strong> drop-down
menu entry to <strong>Journal Selector</strong>.
    <ol>
      <li>Changed the Select default journal window title to "Journal
Selector".</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Corrected spacing issue
affecting Linux Mint (and other distros with larger-than-average text)
in the Welcome to RoboJournal window displayed during First-Run. </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The current search term now
requires the Enter key to be pressed only once in order to run a
search; in 0.4 the user had to press the key twice to trigger the <strong>Search</strong>
button.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The data from the most recent
search is now automatically cleared whenever you change the search type
(any type of pattern match to tag search and vice versa).</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Clicking the Search for whole
words button now causes focus to return to the search term box
automatically (thereby saving the user an extra click).</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> "Speech Balloon" icon option to
entry node choices.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> ALT key shortcut combos to all
boolean (selectable/unselectable) options in RoboJournal Preferences.
The underlined letter in the item description indicates which key is
required to trigger the option (i.e. "<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span>ption 1" would be
triggered by ALT+O).</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> Tag Reminder system. This
feature displays a window that notifies you of any untagged entries in
your journal each time you log in. The Tag Reminder is designed to get
the users into the habit of tagging their entries.
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> option to enable/disable the
Tag Reminder window to the "General" Page in RoboJournal Preferences. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Eliminated the possibility of
the user declaring a "null" tag by using a more sophisticated Regular
Expression to detect attempts instead of relying on a simple ==
operator.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> new feature that allows the name
of the current journal to be displayed in the main window title bar.
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> an option to enable/disable
this behavior to the "General" Page in RoboJournal Preferences. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Disconnecting while there are
search results present on the <strong>Search</strong> tab no longer
crashes the program.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> comprehensive documentation for
RoboJournal 0.4.1 (displayed with the included Qt Assistant program).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="even">
<h2>Version 0.4</h2>
<p>Release Date: 12/17/12</p>
<p>The following changes were made in this release:</p>
<ol>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The background image settings
are now properly disabled when the user enables the custom style
setting. These settings only become active if the user selects a
background image.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> The <b>Use default host and
port</b> checkbox on the Journal Selector window now obeys the current
default values setting in the configuration (with one exception: it is
always enabled during first-run configuration).</li>
  <li>Improved Entry Exporter to allow the user to specify his or her
choice in font/font size for headers and body text in exported HTML
documents. This feature is configured through the new <b>Export
Settings</b> page in the Preferences window.</li>
  <li>Modified date settings to allow the user to show the day of week
when an entry was made.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> batch file to simplify the
removal/cleanup of compiled executables, object code, and
compiler-generated headers between builds. FYI: This tool is only
available in the source package because its purpose is to revert the
source directory to its original state after a compile operation has
taken place.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> the ability to use the same font
settings in both the Editor and Entry Output pane in the main window.
This gives the user a better idea of how the finished entry will look
once it has been saved.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> automated post-processing
features to Editor:
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> whitespace removal feature
which cleans unnecessary line breaks and redundant spaces between words
from the body text.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> HTML-compliant dashes and
hyphenation; all instances of -- are replaced with — and dashes between
numbers are properly elongated (i.e. 1–2).</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> smart quotes feature which
replaces straight (") quotes with curvy (“) quotes. This feature also
affects apostrophes and other single quotes in words.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> miscellaneous processing
features which convert sequences of ≥ 3 adjacent periods to the proper
ellipsis character (…) and formalizes number notation (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup>,
112<sup>th</sup>).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> resistance to common forms of
SQL injection attacks. FYI: Although this new feature provides some
degree of protection, users should <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> assume they are 100%
safe or immune to these attacks.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Solved layout issues which
sometimes caused parts of the user interface to extend beyond the edges
of its window or container object (due to large font size usage at the
operating system level). The user interface for each form now properly
accommodates all but the largest font sizes without issue.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> RoboJournal now requests
confirmation if the user quits the program while the Search tab is
active.</li>
  <li>Added spellcheck functionality (based on Hunspell) to the Editor.
RoboJournal comes with a standard US English dictionary but other
dialects/languages are also supported. Other dictionaries must be
downloaded from third-party sources (compatible dictionaries consist of
a DIC/AFF file pair).</li>
  <li>Added new icons to the program and changed many existing ones.</li>
  <li>Changed wording on Entry Exporter dialog tabs.</li>
  <li>Resizable windows now remember their previous size and position
between sessions.</li>
  <li>Converted the Editor into a toolbar-based layout.</li>
  <li>Main Window, Editor and Preferences windows are now resizable and
remember their sizes between sessions.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> (Ubuntu-specific) The menu
bar in the Main Window remains attached to the window instead of
inheriting the standard Unity menu bar behavior.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Icon-only toolbar button
setting (if enabled) is now preserved after the user manually launches
the Journal Creator or Journal Selector.</li>
  <li><span class="bugfix">Bugfix:</span> Any active journal
connections now automatically terminate if the user manually launches
the Journal Creator or Journal Selector.</li>
  <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span>
Newconfig class. This is meant to be a full replacement (and an
extension) of the original Preferences window. The Newconfig class
features a highly modular design with potential for future expansion.
    <ol>
      <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span>
ConfigurationGeneral, ConfigurationJournal, ConfigurationEditor,
ConfigurationExport, ConfigurationAppearance, and ConfigurationMySQL
classes. Each of these is a separate module (represented as a page on
the Preferences window) which controls specific settings and interacts
with the Newconfig class.</li>
      <li>Users now have the ability to override the colors of the
date/timestamp box and tag box when using a custom theme. It is now
possible to use system colors <em>and</em> a custom theme
simultaneously if desired. In prior releases, the background of those
elements were always the same color as the body text; this new function
is ideal for those who wish to use a custom font but retain the native
OS background.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> Old Config class
(config.cpp, config.h, config.ui). Even though the original Preferences
interface worked fine at first, RoboJournal has grown in size and
complexity over the last few releases to the point where the old
interface had become overcrowded and further expansion was impractical.</li>
      <li>Removed deprecated Config class files from source package and
all references to them in the source code.</li>
      <li>Changed <i>Sort by Day</i> option text to <i>Group journal
entries by day</i>.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> <i>Display full name
(instead of username)</i> option. This displays the user's full name
instead of the abbreviated username in the entry header.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> post-processing options to
the <b>Editor</b> page.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> Export Preview function to
the <b>Export</b> page.</li>
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> Highlighter-related options
to the <b>Journal</b> page.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Win32 executables generated through the Build Helper Script are
now properly stripped (MinGW <i>strip</i> utility). Stripping removes
unneeded data from the executable which improves efficiency and reduces
file size.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> menu shortcut launcher for Linux
systems (robojournal.desktop) to source package (launcher will appear
in desktop environment/window manager apps menu after the user runs
"make install"). This also (hopefully) resolves a bug affecting
versions 0.1 - 0.3 where the RoboJournal Debian package sometimes fails
to create a menu entry after installation.</li>
  <li>Changed Journal Creator launcher text in the Main Window to say
"Journal Creator" instead of "Create a New Journal".</li>
  <li><span class="added"><span class="added">Added</span></span>
SettingsManager class:
    <ol>
      <li>All settings are now handled through SettingsManager class.</li>
      <li>Changed "STAGE 1" startup text to reference the new
SettingsManager Class.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> Original
configuration file (<i>$HomePath/.robojournal/robojournal.cfg</i>).
Configuration settings are now stored in <i>$HomePath/.robojournal/robojournal.ini</i>
instead.</li>
      <li><span class="deprecated">Deprecated:</span> ConfigManager
class. Removed configmanager.cpp and configmanager.h (and all
references to them in the source code) from the source package.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> shortcut key (Q) to the exit
confirmation dialog in Main Window.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> gender check during first-run
configuration which sets a different username avatar icon for female
users.</li>
  <li>Removed extra space around the edge of the layout in the Main
Window.</li>
  <li><span class="added">Added</span> search feature to main window:
    <ol class="letter">
      <li><span class="added">Added</span> tabbed interface to main
window splitter.</li>
      <li>Placed journal entry tree in the <b>Entries</b> tab.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="odd">
<h2>Version 0.3</h2>

    <ol class="letter">

Name</b>, <b>Journal Host</b>, and <b>Username</b> fields.</li>
